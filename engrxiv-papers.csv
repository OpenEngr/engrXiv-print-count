Washing of the purchased materials from markets, our hands and washing of other items by water or soap water have increased many folds.  For this purpose, an innovative machine (2ft length, 1.5ft breadth and 1.5 ft height) has been designed by multimodal approaches. The approaches includes UVC (254 nm), heat and copper metal  treatment for inactivation of SARS CoV2. Machine includes  two cycles, one UVC cycle and another heat cycle to inactivate or kill virus. Both cycles can be operated at one time or separately one after another. In this machine four UVC tubes (each 15 W) were fitted in different angles to irradiate maximum UVC to the items distantly located in the cabinet of machine. The dose of UVC, time of the exposure and maximum distance of the item were standardized in such as way that 99.999% inactivation of SARS- CoV2 occurred within 30 to 40 min The maximum dose  was 18,331 J/m2 of UVC in this cabinet. SARS CoV2 isolate multiplied in Vero-E6 cell line and treated by UVC cycle  at the maximum distance 9 inch and heat cycle at 50 to 600C temperature separately  for 30 to 40 min. Infectivity of treated virus was tested in Vero E6 cell line by TCID 50 assay  and this assay  has confirmed that this treated virus has no infection capacity. In conclusion, this designed cabinet must serve our society as proper decontamination or SARS CoV2 inactivation  in pandemic situation to break the transmission chain of this virus and save our precious water.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f2d0287479288002585955d/,1,https://engrxiv.org/q4znx/,10.31224/osf.io/q4znx,,2020-08-07T13:20:17.654553,2020-08-07T13:20:48.749355
b86my,"An Approach for the Accurate Investigation of Full-Scale Ship Boundary Layers and Wakes","Existing recommended practices in the literature do not provide clear and concise guidance for the selection of the most suitable numerical modelling strategy for investigating the boundary layer around a ship at full scale. For example, the International Towing Tank Conference procedure for calculating the nominal wake fields of full-scale ships does not clearly specify which turbulence modelling approach should be used to accurately represent the near-wall flow in the ship’s aft region.
This paper presents a numerical approach that can accurately represent the boundary layer of full-scale ships. Three turbulence modelling strategies, suitable for the simulation of ship flows, have been assessed:  k-ε, k-ω SST RANS and an IDDES formulation. Results from each method have been compared against the full-scale ship propeller torque data of the MV Regal, a 138m long general cargo vessel. Additionally, the capability of each turbulence strategy to resolve time-dependent features of the flow, such as the bilge vortex and its effect on the boundary layer velocity fields, has been evaluated.
The results from this investigation show that the IDDES based numerical model replicated the sea trials measurements with the highest degree of accuracy. Furthermore, this study confirmed that the choice of turbulence strategy has a major impact on the full-scale velocity fields in the aft region of a ship.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f2c78aa479288000d857b95/,5,https://engrxiv.org/b86my/,10.31224/osf.io/b86my,,2020-08-06T23:57:56.043762,2020-08-07T02:33:33.105696
pjkbq,"Machine-learning-assisted fabrication: Bayesian optimization of laser-induced graphene patterning using in-situ Raman analysis","The control of the physical, chemical, and electronic properties of laser-induced graphene (LIG) is crucial in the fabrication of flexible electronic devices. However, the optimization of LIG production is time-consuming and costly. Here, we demonstrate state-of-the-art automated parameter tuning techniques using Bayesian optimization to advance rapid single-step laser patterning and structuring capabilities with a view to fabricate graphene-based electronic devices. In particular, a large search space of parameters for LIG explored efficiently. As a result, high-quality LIG patterns exhibiting high Raman G/D ratios at least a factor of four larger than those found in the literature were achieved within 50 optimization iterations in which the laser power, irradiation time, pressure and type of gas were optimized. Human-interpretable conclusions may be derived from our machine learning model to aid our understanding of the underlying mechanism for substrate-dependent LIG growth, e.g. high-quality graphene patterns are obtained at low and high gas pressures for quartz and polyimide, respectively. Our Bayesian optimization search method allows for an efficient experimental design that is independent of the experience and skills of individual researchers, while reducing experimental time and cost and accelerating materials research.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f2af0a99c909402bd487953/,5,https://engrxiv.org/pjkbq/,10.31224/osf.io/pjkbq,10.1016/j.carbon.2020.05.087,2020-08-06T14:55:57.261513,2020-08-06T14:58:02.537956

vmp3y,"Design and testing of a full-scale 2 MW tidal turbine blade","The Large Structures Research Group of MaREI, Orbital Marine Power Ltd and ÉireComposites Teo. have designed a full-scale blade for a next-generation 2 MW tidal turbine as part of the H2020 FloTEC project. The 8.5 m long blade will be tested under static load conditions through the H2020 MaRINET2 transnational access programme and fatigue conditions through the OCEAN ERA-NET SEABLADE project. This paper provides an overview of the initial design study which analysed the impact of using a single shear web or two shear webs in the design. The result of this design study led to optimisation of the laminates throughout the blade to reduce the cost of manufacture and, hence, the levelized cost of energy of the device. The finite element analyses were performed using the MaREI@NUI Galway composite blade design software BladeComp. From the results of the analyses a single web design was chosen for the blade. The present work also describes the set-up for the structural tests and an overview of the data acquisition and instrumentation requirements for full-scale static and fatigue blade testing.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f2ac992b084f602bec99062/,7,https://engrxiv.org/vmp3y/,10.31224/osf.io/vmp3y,,2020-08-06T03:13:49.645229,2020-08-06T03:14:11.140015
zuvxf,"Matrix Manipulator","In computation involving matrices it is frequently necessary to interchange or rearrange rows or columns of a matrix. If the work is being done longhand or with a desk calculator, it is desirable to be able to perform the rearrangement without having to erase or rewrite numbers. In mathematics, matrix addition or subtraction, multiplication or the matrix product or any other arithmetic operation is a binary operation that produces a matrix from two matrices. 
The matrix manipulator was devised for the use in the Bureau’s statistical Engineering Laboratory for calculation with incidence matrices, i.e., matrices whose element are all 0’s or 1’s. So, through this project we will show how the matrix manipulation is taking place using MIPS programming language. MIPS is a reduced instruction set computer set architecture developed by MIPS Technologies. The early MIPS architecture was 32-bit with 64-bit versions added later. Also, the project is compiled to show Matrix addition of two different matrices, subtraction of two different matrices, multiplication, transpose, determinant, scaling of matrix.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f2a86f99c9094028648da34/,4,https://engrxiv.org/zuvxf/,10.31224/osf.io/zuvxf,,2020-08-05T15:04:15.469059,2020-08-05T15:04:43.960205
ej7u3,"Where that emissions went? Characterising the uncertainty of characterisation factors of underspecified emissions.","Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methods use unspecified archetypes to model situations of imperfect knowledge. There is an inherent uncertainty in characterisation factors to unspecified archetypes, and this study proposes an estimation of this uncertainty using continuous and discrete probability distributions. The extent of “archetype uncertainty” is analysed for several methods and the impact on LCIA scores is quantified for all activities in the database ecoinvent. Results indicate that this source of uncertainty can be very large, introducing systematic as well as random errors in LCIA scores. Based on this research we recommend using undefined archetypes only when needed and quantify this source of uncertainty by default. The continuous and discrete approaches to model uncertainty give similar results, but the continuous approach is easier to implement.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f2921ccb084f60202c9a430/,18,https://engrxiv.org/ej7u3/,10.31224/osf.io/ej7u3,,2020-08-04T13:34:44.581888,2020-08-04T13:35:10.348301
t3q5p,"Recent Data Augmentation Strategies for Deep Learning in Plant Phenotyping and Their Significance","Plant phenotyping concerns the study of plant traits resulted from their interaction with their environment. Computer vision (CV) techniques represent promising, non-invasive approaches for related tasks such as leaf counting, defining leaf area, and tracking plant growth. Between potential CV techniques, deep learning has been prevalent in the last couple of years. Such an increase in interest happened mainly due to the release of a data set containing rosette plants that defined objective metrics to benchmark solutions. This paper discusses an interesting aspect of the recent best-performing works in this field: the fact that their main contribution comes from novel data augmentation techniques, rather than model improvements. Moreover, experiments are set to highlight the significance of data augmentation practices for limited data sets with narrow distributions. This paper intends to review the ingenious techniques to generate synthetic data to augment training and display evidence of their potential importance.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f291a72b084f60202c996d5/,6,https://engrxiv.org/t3q5p/,10.31224/osf.io/t3q5p,,2020-08-04T13:32:55.878099,2020-08-04T13:33:24.291825
u6fcb,"A Holistic Optimization Model for Integrated Tactical Level Planning in Liner Shipping","Supply chain management plays an important role in ensuring an efficient merchandise trade. Freight transportation is an integral part of supply chain management. A significant part of freight transportation is covered by maritime transportation, as the largest portion of the global merchandise trade, in terms of volume, is carried out by maritime transportation. Liner shipping, which runs on fixed routes and schedules, plays a colossal role for the global seaborne trade. Liner shipping companies deal with three decision levels, namely strategic level, tactical level, and operational level. The strategic-level decisions are taken for more than six months to several years. The tactical-level decisions are effective for three months to six months. Moreover, the operational level decisions are taken for a couple of weeks to less than three months.

This dissertation involves the tactical-level decisions in liner shipping, which include: (1) service frequency determination; (2) fleet deployment; (3) sailing speed optimization; and (4) vessel scheduling. The service frequency determination problem deals with determining the time headway between consecutive vessels along a liner shipping route. The fleet deployment problem assigns vessels from the liner shipping company’s fleet (and sometimes, from other liner shipping companies’ fleets) to liner shipping routes. The sailing speed optimization problem deals with selecting sailing speeds along different voyage legs of a given port rotation. The vessel scheduling problem lists the schedules (e.g., arrival time, handling time, departure time) at different ports.

A comprehensive review of the liner shipping literature revealed that the existing literature on the tactical-level decisions focused on these problems individually. Solutions from different solution methodologies for the separate problems may have compatibility problems. Moreover, they are not attractive to the liner shipping companies, who look for integrated solutions. Hence, this research aimed to develop a combined mathematical model that comprises the four tactical-level decisions in liner shipping (i.e., service frequency determination, fleet deployment, sailing speed optimization, and vessel scheduling). This mathematical model is named the Holistic Optimization Model for Tactical-Level Planning in Liner Shipping (HOMTLP).

The objective of the HOMTLP mathematical model is to maximize of the total profit from transport of cargo. The major route service cost components, found from the literature, are covered by the model, which include: (I) total late arrival cost; (II) total port handling cost; (III) total fuel consumption cost; (IV) total vessel operational cost; (V) total vessel chartering cost; (VI) total container inventory cost in sea; (VII) total container inventory cost at ports of call; (VIII) total emission cost in sea; and (IX) total emission cost at ports of call. Along with the integration of all four tactical-level decisions, the mathematical model has a number of key advantages. First, the model provides flexibility to both the liner shipping company and the marine container terminal operators, as it offers multiple time windows and handling rates at each port of call. Second, the payload carried by the vessels is considered while estimating fuel consumption. Third, the preference of customers is reflected by modification of the container demand at different sailing speeds. Fourth, container inventory is accounted for at ports of call and in sea. Fifth, emissions of different harmful substances are captured in order to preserve the environment.

This dissertation carried out a set of numerical experiments to test the performance of the HOMTLP model, where BARON was used as the solution approach. It was revealed that when there was an increase in the unit fuel cost, the unit emission cost, vessel availability, the unit late arrival cost, and the unit freight rate, the sailing speed was reduced. On the other hand, when there was an increase in the unit inventory cost, the unit operational cost, as well as the unit chartering cost, the sailing speed was increased. Moreover, the total required number of vessels was increased, when there as an increase in the unit fuel cost, the unit emission cost, vessel availability, the unit late arrival cost, and the unit freight rate. On the contrary, the total required number of vessels was decreased, when there was an increase in the unit inventory cost, the unit operational cost as well as the unit chartering cost. It was also revealed that the total profit was increased, when more choices were available for time windows and/or container handling rates. The numerical experiments highlighted several other findings. Most importantly, it was found that the HOMTLP model can provide effective tactical-level decisions. Hence, the mathematical model can assist liner shipping companies to take tactical-level decisions, which are effective and profitable.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f28755c5f705a01f36181b4/,23,https://engrxiv.org/u6fcb/,10.31224/osf.io/u6fcb,,2020-08-04T13:31:18.825197,2020-08-04T13:31:44.200521
z674t,"Large Eddy Simulation of Hurricane Boundary Layer Turbulence and Its Application for Power Transmission System","Recent extreme hurricanes caused a huge loss in damages to critical civil infrastructure. To estimate hurricane wind loading on structures, spectral methods are widely used to generate neutral atmosphere boundary layer winds, which however are limited to describe extreme wind fields that are non-stationary and more turbulent. To overcome this limitation, a high-fidelity high-resolution computational model is developed to simulate hurricane wind field with detailed physics. A large eddy simulation (LES) solver is developed using a sub-grid-scale model based on open source program OpenFOAM. The simulated wind field is validated through comparison with observations. The generated wind field is applied to analyze structural response of a power transmission system. The proposed hurricane boundary layer (HBL) model and a neutral atmosphere boundary layer (ABL) model are compared in tropical storm and category-3 hurricane scenarios. Compared with the HBL model, the ABL model doesn't consider the mesoscale terms and overestimates the crosswind velocity and the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) near the ground. As a result, the ABL model overestimates the dynamic responses of the wires and towers. The developed HBL model captures the main characteristics of hurricane wind and is applicable for modeling civil infrastructure exposed to hurricanes at a large scale.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f286fba5f705a01ee618daa/,60,https://engrxiv.org/z674t/,10.31224/osf.io/z674t,,2020-08-04T13:28:20.901497,2020-08-04T13:28:40.882372
k26rp,"Low Speed Wind Tunnel Flow Diagnostics and Benchmark Cases for Thermal Fluids CFD Validation Efforts","A low speed, closed loop wind tunnel at Texas A&amp;M University is presented for the study of turbulent mixing produced by a variety of flows types. Anticipated experiments range from canonical “unit flows” to more complex combinations of flows and geometries. Originally located at the University of Pittsburgh, the facility has since been re-located to the Thermal Hydraulics Verification and Validation (THVV) laboratory at Texas A&amp;M University. The tunnel has undergone considerable modification and updated diagnostics prompting renewed interest in flow quality assessment. This includes a thorough mapping of the tunnel inlet velocity profile provided by Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements. Additional temperature and gage pressure measurements complete the assessment of system capabilities. These preliminary diagnostics yield empirically determined boundary conditions and fluid property correlations necessary for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model validation. The article concludes with the presentation of two unit flow types, including flow past a cylinder, with three distinct cross sections, and a single round jet in cross flow at three velocity ratios. The unit flows serve as initial benchmarks for THVV simulation efforts. Key validation metrics are presented for each benchmark including ensemble averaged velocities, Reynolds stresses, and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) eigenvectors.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f281d3db084f601bbc9abc9/,26,https://engrxiv.org/k26rp/,10.31224/osf.io/k26rp,,2020-08-03T18:46:48.943284,2020-08-03T18:47:21.432405

g4z72,"A numerical investigation of the initiation of aortic dissection","In the first part of this study we develop a realistic subject-specific aorta finite element model derived from a dual-venc MRI scan. We investigate if spontaneous dissection will occur under extreme hypertensive lumen blood pressure loading, or if significant reduction in interface strength must occur in order for dissection to initiate. Importantly, we also demonstrate that dissection initiation is a pure mode II fracture process, rather than a mixed mode or mode I process. In the second part of this study we construct a parameterised idealised aorta model in order to assess the relative contribution for several anatomical and physiological factors to dissection risk. Such parametric analyses provide fundamental insight into the mechanics of stress localisation and delamination in the aorta. Overall, our detailed series of simulations suggest that variations in anatomical features and hypertensive loading will not result in a sufficient elevation of the stress state in the aorta wall to initiate dissection. Our results suggest that initiation of aortic dissection requires a significant reduction in the mode II fracture strength of the aortic wall, suggesting that dissection is preceded by structural and biomechanical remodelling.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f247a815f705a011361a3f3/,27,https://engrxiv.org/g4z72/,10.31224/osf.io/g4z72,,2020-07-31T21:24:42.777699,2020-07-31T21:25:04.291178
jr3tx,"Analysis of cylindrically and spherically embossed flux barriers in non-oriented electrical steel","In reluctance and permanent magnet synchronous machines, flux barriers are crucial for magnetic flux guidance. Designed as cutouts, flux barriers reduce the mechanical strength of the rotor construction. To operate these electric drives at higher rotational speed, an alternative flux barrier design is required. Since residual stress influences the magnetic properties of soft magnetic materials, this paper deals with embossing induced residual stress as flux barriers in non-oriented electrical steel with 2.4 wt% silicon and a sheet thickness of 0.35 mm. The investigated flux barriers were fabricated with a cylindrical or spherical punch at two different penetration depths and were compared to a flux barrier fabricated as cutout. A residual stress analysis using Finite Element Analysis helps understanding the mechanism of embossed flux barriers. Additionally, the influence of induced residual stress on the magnetic material behavior is measured using standardized single sheet tests and neutron grating interferometry measurements. This investigation aimed at a better understanding of the flux barrier design by local induction of residual stress.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f2273e55f705a0025622e47/,23,https://engrxiv.org/jr3tx/,10.31224/osf.io/jr3tx,,2020-07-30T18:34:47.409474,2020-08-03T09:03:57.608009

The rate of complications is associated with a lack of consensus about the surgical decision-making process; choices about the instrumentation length, the anchoring implants and the degree of correction are indeed mostly based on personal views and previous experience of the surgeon. In this work, we performed an in silico clinical trial on a large number of subjects in order to clarify which factors have the highest importance in determining the risk of post-operative complications by quantitatively analysing the mechanical stresses and loads in the instrumentation after the correction maneuvers. The results of the simulations highlighted the fundamental role of the curve severity, also in its three-dimensional aspect, and of the instrumentation strategy, whereas the length of the fixation had a lower importance.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f20113661875e017631b90d/,24,https://engrxiv.org/4snpv/,10.31224/osf.io/4snpv,,2020-07-28T14:24:26.123658,2020-07-28T14:26:16.245049

Pavement condition data is collected by the Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) and stored in a Pavement-Management Information System (PMIS). Typically, the overall pavement condition is quantified using the Pavement Condition Index (PCI), which is a weighted average of indices representing different types of distress, roughness, and deflection. Deterioration models of PCI as a function of time were developed for the different pavement types using two modeling approaches. The first approach is the Long/Short Term Memory (LSTM), a subset of a recurrent neural network. The second approach, used by the Iowa DOT, is developing individual regression models for each section of the different pavement types. A comparison is made between the two approaches to assess the accuracy of each model. The results show that while the individual regression models achieved higher prediction accuracy with respect to asphalt pavements, the LSTM model achieved a higher prediction accuracy over time for concrete and composite pavement types.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f1f639f5fdf620173046fe5/,12,https://engrxiv.org/edhvy/,10.31224/osf.io/edhvy,,2020-07-28T02:49:44.384328,2020-07-28T02:50:01.845613

The objective of this research is to determine the correct parameters for the process of making PCB design easier, cheaper and safer.
Electronic circuit design was created on a laptop or PC using Autodesk EAGLE software with a combination of result is black and blue light color. PCB routing design was inserted into a PowerPoint slide to display on a commercial Digital Light Processing (DLP) projector. No
modifications were made to a projector, which was mounted directly on a stand with a downward
facing position. The projector lamp replaced an ultraviolet or X-ray source during the exposure
process, exposing PCB coated in negative dry film photoresist. After the exposure process, the PCB was inserted into the developer solution, causing the blue light irradiated part to remain while the blackened sections dissolved. The PCB was then added to an etching solution to scrape the copper unprotected by the photoresist. The PCB was finally soaked in a remover solution to remove the photoresist. Once complete, the process generated a laptop-designed PCB routing. Electrical lines can be created using this method with a size of 100 µm and a lane edge deviation of 5 µm. The goal of research to make PCB routing cheaper, easier and safer was achieved. Evidenced by the installation of electronic components and then tested, the results are all components function well.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f1e363f32080500ec157ab9/,20,https://engrxiv.org/27f49/,10.31224/osf.io/27f49,,2020-07-28T02:55:15.888079,2020-07-28T02:55:40.944080
w25kj,"Inverse modeling of zonal transmission network","Presently, many ideas have been proposed for constructing zonal models of the European transmission network. Most of them are based on transmission network reduction and bus clustering, which requires the ex-ante knowledge on the details (impedance, interconnections, etc.) of the network’s elements. Generally, the information is not publicly disclosed. This paper describes a method for serving the purpose, which only requires the ex-post (i.e., published) inter-zonal power flow data as input. It performs inverse modeling on the ex-post data to reveal the virtual reactance of the interconnectors in the zonal model. The reactance values are then used for computing the zonal Power Transfer Distribution Factors (PTDFs) of the model, which is the best representation of the loop flows. A large number of such zonal PTDFs could exist in one zonal model because of its dependency on the Generation Shift Keys (GSKs). Theoretically, the GSKs could exist as an infinite set of unique combinations but only a finite number of them applied in real system operations. As a solution, the authors propose a heuristic approach for grouping the ex-post power flow cases into clusters, and find the zonal PTDF for each of them; in order to effectively reduce the domain of the zonal PTDFs and enhance the tractability of the solution. The identified zonal PTDFs meaningfully represent the zonal model. Additionally, they can also be used for studying the best and worst case scenarios of cross-border security-constrained economic dispatch.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f1c49f832080500a9159462/,30,https://engrxiv.org/w25kj/,10.31224/osf.io/w25kj,,2020-07-25T15:21:03.718632,2020-07-26T04:03:22.328236

It is critical to understand if and how these changes may persist as economies gradually reopen. Using 2 years of observed electricity consumption data from more than 3.8 million residential and non-residential customers from the Commonwealth Edison utility in Illinois, we show that the onset of COVID-19 shifted weekday residential load profiles to closely resemble weekend profiles from previous years. We use this finding to estimate the potential impact of continued COVID-19-type profiles of electricity use on total load profiles.

However, modularization to allow multiple use of modules often implies oversizing of modules. Therefore, modular lightweight design is contradictory to the core idea of lightweight design. The interdisciplinary development of mechatronic systems increases the need for trade-offs between lightweight design and modularization, since all disciplines involved have a direct influence on the definition of the product architecture. These trade-offs lead to a highly iterative approach. To reduce iteration loops and shorten product development time, the requirements are transferred into a target system and decision criteria between the modularization of a mechatronic system and the potentials of lightweight design are derived.

Currently neither hydrogen nor electricity are inevitable. Is electrification the single obvious solution, or is a combination with hydrogen more functional and cost-effective? Scotland makes a good exemplar of transport Transition, with a defined geography, a world leading Net-Zero ambition, and proven pathways for generating large amounts of renewable energy. 
We identified essential elements of the new transport systems, including CapEx and OpEx and emissions through transition. We developed five scenarios modelled for transition around varying the pace of change for some or all vehicle classes. Monte Carlo simulations investigated the emissions, vehicle mixes, construction speed, and costs.
CapEx to install generation and refuelling infrastructure for electricity or for hydrogen favours hydrogen by a substantial margin, with multi £Bn cost-reductions. Untaxed OpEx costs favour electricity, such that whole system costs are broadly similar for any mix, although untaxed per-km fuel costs for either should be lower than hydrocarbons. User experience, energy storage, vehicle characteristics, social factors, use of natural resources – almost all favour increased hydrogen use. Hydrogen interseasonal storage at national scale is feasible in salt caverns, with re-purposing of the transmission pipeline grid, and huge scale-up of generation; interseasonal electricity storage does not exist at national scale, and significant electrification penetration requires immense infrastructure upgrades.

The goal of this study is to evaluate the filtration efficiency and breathability of improvised filtration and commonly available mask materials, as well as to assess their reusability. Materials readily available to the general public such as cotton, fragrance and additive-free dry baby cleaning wipes, and those abundantly available in the hospital setting, such as sterilization wraps, were chosen for testing, amongst others. In the COVID-important 2–5 m particle range, two-layers of cotton provided filtration efficiency between 34%–66%.  Amongst potential filter materials, 300-weight sterilization wraps provided approximately 80% filtration efficiency and are readily available in the healthcare setting.  The addition of sterilization wrap to cotton fabrics brought the filtration efficiency to above that of the sterilization wrap (80%-90%) at the expense of added pressure drop. Four-layers of dry baby wipes performed very well with a filtration efficiency of 85% and a reasonable pressure drop (1/3 of procedure mask). Since the material is advertised as pure spunlace polypropylene and designed to contact the skin during cleaning, it would appear generally safe as a filter insert.  Of improvised filters, polypropylene electrostatic HVAC filters performed the best with filtration efficiencies of &gt;99%, but are not recommended due to the risk of confusion with glass-based HVAC filters and uncertainty regarding trace materials used in the filter.  The filtration efficiency of two-layers of cotton fabrics with one-layer of sterilization wrap slightly improved over 10 laundry cycles, while the performance of other non-wovens, like dry baby wipes, degraded more rapidly and should be considered disposable.  In summary, we found that a two-layer cotton fabric can provide a comfortable, breathable and reusable option. The addition of a sterilization wrap or four-layers of pure spunlace fragrance free dry baby wipes can significantly improve filtration and block expiratory aerosols at the expense of an added pressure drop.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f18907486a05500220dde2b/,176,https://engrxiv.org/nrtgb/,10.31224/osf.io/nrtgb,,2020-07-24T13:26:34.855760,2020-07-24T13:27:02.213842

Consequently, this results in overconfidence in the identified parameters and, in turn, optimistic reactor designs. In this work, we assess the strengths and weaknesses of a method to statistically describe these patterns with autocorrelated error models.

Unlike other games which have a standardized playing area, the terrain in a golf course comprises of various natural and manmade features viz. fairways, bunkers, trees, water bodies etc, which increase the difficulty level of the game and keep the players challenged.

SOLF divides the project into 18 stages wherein each stage of the project will have 3 to 6 tasks which are required to be completed within a fixed timeline. The stages are managed by creating checklists at the start akin to the pre-shot routines in golf and the customer feedback is received on reaching each of the milestones similar to applause in the game of golf. Terrain of the golf course is reflected as risk list which are varying for each of the stages.

We perform a rigorous investigation of the factors that govern clot occlusion of a tapered vessel. The motivation for such an analysis is two-fold: (i) the role of clot composition on the in-vivo occlusion location is an open clinical question that has significant implications for thrombectomy procedures; (ii) in-vitro measurement of occlusion location in an engineered tapered tube can be used as a quick and simple methodology to assess the mechanical properties/compositions of clots. Simulations demonstrate that both isochoric and volumetric behaviour of clots are key determinants of clot lodgement location, in addition to clot-vessel friction.

This assessment is completed through two benchmarking exercises: (1) determining the failure envelope of a strip foundation subjected to combined loading and (2) quantifying the force-displacement history for the soil cutting process (e.g., for applications in soil-machine interaction).",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f14dbc40870f200d5099d83/,71,https://engrxiv.org/jqytk/,10.31224/osf.io/jqytk,,2020-07-20T15:25:06.163434,2020-07-20T15:25:44.569511

qxzp8,"Hybrid Data + Model-Based Submodeling Method for a Refined Response Estimation at Critical Locations","The complex geometry of structural components results in uneven stress distribution in structures under loading. The regions with stress concentrations often act as critical locations from where damages can initiate and propagate under different types of loading. Accurate estimation of stress distribution, especially at such critical locations, is vital for a more reliable prediction of possible damage prognosis or remaining useful life (RUL) estimation of the structure or a component. Traditional sensing methods often provide response measurements at a few localized points and demand sensor deployment in large numbers to get a distributed response. This may yet be sparse for the steep changes in stress at critical locations. In this study, we propose a hybrid data + model-based submodeling (HDMS) method to achieve a refined estimate of distributed structural response in and around the critical locations. The HDMS method uses just the measured response on the pre-selected boundaries around the locations of interest, as input to drive the corresponding submodel of a structural component or a connection, given its geometry and material properties are known. The performance of the HDMS method in response estimation is demonstrated through two vertically loaded plates, one with two holes connected by a slit and the other with two wide slits, respectively. The refined response estimated by HDMS could determine asymmetric response, nonlinear behavior, and permanent set at the critical locations with an average error less than 50 μstrain at higher load stages, making HDMS a versatile method for refined response estimation.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f0f1b3fe8dcdd00b4ef69e3/,32,https://engrxiv.org/qxzp8/,10.31224/osf.io/qxzp8,,2020-07-15T16:36:50.527203,2020-07-15T16:37:44.484010
myp6c,"PDCOVIDNet: A Parallel-Dilated Convolutional Neural Network Architecture for Detecting COVID-19 from Chest X-Ray Images","The COVID-19 pandemic continues to severely undermine the prosperity of the global health system. To combat this pandemic, effective screening techniques for infected patients are indispensable. There is no doubt that the use of chest X-ray images for radiological assessment is one of the essential screening techniques. Some of the early studies revealed that the patient’s chest X-ray images showed abnormalities, which is natural for patients infected with COVID-19. In this paper,
we proposed a parallel-dilated convolutional neural network (CNN) based COVID-19 detection system from chest x-ray images, named as Parallel-Dilated COVIDNet (PDCOVIDNet). First, the publicly available chest X-ray collection fully preloaded and enhanced, and then classified by the proposed method. Differing convolution dilation rate in a parallel form demonstrates the proof-of-principle for using PDCOVIDNet to extract radiological features for COVID-19 detection. Accordingly, we have assisted our method with two visualization methods, which are specifically designed to increase understanding of the key components associated with COVID-19 infection. Both visualization methods compute gradients for a given image category related to feature maps of the last convolutional layer to create a class-discriminative region. In our experiment, we used a total of 2,905 chest X-ray images, comprising three cases (such as COVID-19, normal, and viral pneumonia), and empirical evaluations revealed that the proposed method extracted more significant
features expeditiously related to suspected disease. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves performance metrics: the accuracy, precision, recall and F1 scores reach 96.58%, 96.58%, 96.59% and 96.58%, respectively, which is comparable or enhanced compared with the state-of-the-art methods. We believe that our contribution can support resistance to COVID-19, and will adopt for COVID-19 screening in AI-based systems.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f0e967456f7a4007b393966/,77,https://engrxiv.org/myp6c/,10.31224/osf.io/myp6c,,2020-07-15T14:26:19.701304,2020-07-15T14:27:10.762625
j8aq4,"A probabilistic hot water usage model and simulator for use in residential energy management","Water heating contributes up to 40% of a household's total electricity usage and places a substantial burden on the electricity grid due to high power ratings and users' largely simultaneous hot water usage. The main determinants of its electricity draw are physical properties such as set temperature, insulation, and plumbing configuration; environmental conditions such as ambient temperature and inlet temperature; and the hot water usage profiles. These profiles include the usage volumes, the times of usage and the outlet temperatures. The efficacy of energy management techniques that model water heaters and the accuracy of their simulation results therefore rely on representative hot water usage profiles. Existing models for household hot water usage neglect differences between users, and temporal variations such as the season and the day of the week, and are not fully autonomous. We propose a probabilistic data-driven model for modelling individualised hot water profiles and an accompanying hot water usage simulator that includes all these factors. We gathered data from 77 residential households over a period of one year to train and evaluate the model for all four seasons. The results show that the simulated hot water usage profiles match the statistical properties of the measured data. Moreover, the individual hot water usage modelling and the resulting aggregated energy load on the grid closely match the measured data, improving on the existing hot water usage by halving the modelling error.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f0dbc8a56f7a4003538f32c/,38,https://engrxiv.org/j8aq4/,10.31224/osf.io/j8aq4,,2020-07-14T15:56:00.557821,2020-07-14T15:56:21.524116

Expansion work recovery using a two-phase ejector is widely recognized as one of the most promising measures to improve the energy efficiency of RACHP units. This holds true for all operation conditions provided that an effective capacity control technique is implemented. In this work a thorough critical review on the current status of the presently available capacity control techniques for two-phase ejectors was carried out. In addition, their pros and cons as well as the comparison of their performance were reported. It was concluded that two-phase ejectors can be properly capacity controlled in large- and medium-scale vapour-compression units. However, a suitable capacity control mechanism for small-scale vapour-compression solutions still requires a major breakthrough and is being intensively discussed among experts in the field.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f0dab10e85f46003590dc83/,21,https://engrxiv.org/kg7u9/,10.31224/osf.io/kg7u9,,2020-07-14T13:14:53.406929,2020-07-14T14:44:43.806586

g6dse,"A new anisotropic soft tissue model for elimination of unphysical auxetic behaviour","Auxetic behaviour , the unphysical transverse expansion during uniaxial tension, is a common and undesirable feature of classical anisotropic hyperelastic constitutive models for soft tissue. In this study we uncover the underlying mechanism of such behaviour; high levels of in-plane compaction occurs due to increasing tension in strain-stiffening fibres, leading to unphysical out-of-plane expansion. We demonstrate that auxetic behaviour is primarily influenced by the ratio of fibre to matrix stiffness, and is accentuated by strain-stiffening fibres in a constant stiffness matrix (e.g., the widely used neo-Hookean matrix with exponentially stiffening fibres). We propose a new bilinear strain stiffening fibre and matrix (BLFM) model which allows close control of the fibre-matrix stiffness ratio, thereby robustly eliminating auxetic behaviour. We demonstrate that our model provides accurate prediction of experimentally observed out-of-plane compaction, in addition to stress-stretch anisotropy, for arterial tissue subjected to uniaxial tension testing.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f0ccefd0aa09901191597b4/,77,https://engrxiv.org/g6dse/,10.31224/osf.io/g6dse,,2020-07-14T13:12:50.342291,2020-07-14T14:44:48.251084

The backbone of the composite TPS material used in the NASA Stardust Sample Return Capsule and the Mars 2020 mission is carbon fiber, which oxidizes at these temperatures and atmospheric conditions. This study presents the direct observation of carbon oxidation using in situ Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM). A thin section of a commercially-available carbon fiber material containing multiple carbon structures was examined by STEM in a closed-environmental cell in which temperature was raised from 25 to 1050àC under a steady flow of air. Results show that the random polycrystalline carbon structure oxidized more uniformly and rapidly than the single crystallite region, which oxidized more anisotropically. These findings are the first to directly observe the structural dependence of carbon oxidation rates at these length-scales while also giving important insight into the onset of pitting at various active surface sites, important pieces in fundamentally understanding of carbon oxidation.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f09ee740aa099007f15b419/,58,https://engrxiv.org/y8u4z/,10.31224/osf.io/y8u4z,,2020-07-12T13:29:06.646570,2020-07-29T13:05:40.311718
kcf3s,"In Vitro Quantification of Stent-Graft Behaviour During ch-TEVAR","Purpose: To quantify dynamic gutter phenomena and endograft deformations during double chimney thoracic endovascular aortic repair (ch-TEVAR) in a physiological model of the thoracic aorta subjected to pulsatile haemodynamic conditions. Methods: Two in vitro procedures revascularizing the brachiocephalic trunk and left common carotid artery were performed representing both balloon-expandable (BE, Ankura-BeGraft) and self-expandable (SE, Ankura-Viabahn) double ch-TEVAR configurations. Retrospectively gated computed tomography (CT) was used to evaluate endograft behaviour. Device interactions were characterised according to gutter volume, gutter surface deviation, and endograft deformation (D-ratio) at end-diastolic and peak-systolic aortic pressure. Results: Use of BE chimney grafts resulted in three times total gutter volume compared to SE chimney grafts. Gutter volumes were observed to vary dynamically between the end-diastolic and peak-systolic phases of the cardiac cycle, with the most substantial change associated with the BE configuration. Chimney graft deformations were dependent on device type, with SE devices exhibiting up to twice the deformation as BE devices. When adjacent, SE chimney grafts were observed to support each other, and thus tended towards a more consistently circular shape. Conclusions: Gutter and chimney graft behaviour were dependent on device type, and exhibited both spatial and temporal variability. This study emphasizes notable differences between BE and SE double ch-TEVAR configurations which should be considered when evaluating risk of endoleak. The findings reported here also support the use of gated CT to better identify and predict device related complications in ch-TEVAR, and can be used in the design of next generation devices.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f08cf860aa099005e1598e9/,49,https://engrxiv.org/kcf3s/,10.31224/osf.io/kcf3s,,2020-07-11T14:06:32.596167,2020-07-11T14:06:41.533501
3zx2b,"Thoracic Aortic Parallel Stent-Graft Behaviour When Subjected to Radial Loading","To manage complex aortic arch disease using minimally invasive techniques, interventionalists have reported the use of multiple stent-graft devices deployed in a parallel configuration. The structural device-device and device-artery interactions arising during aortic arch parallel endografting, also known as chimney thoracic endovascular aortic repair (ch-TEVAR), is not well understood. Through the use of a radial force testing system we sought to characterise both the loading and deformation behaviour of parallel endografts in representative ch-TEVAR configurations. Four commercially available devices (Bentley BeGraft, Gore TAG, Gore Viabahn, and Medtronic Valiant) were subjected to uniform radial load individually, and in six combinations, to quantify loading profiles. Image data collected during testing were analysed to evaluate mechanical deformations in terms of gutters, chimney and main endograft compression, as well as graft infolding. Parallel endografting was found to increase radial loads when compared to standard TEVAR. Chronic outward force during ch-TEVAR was dependent on main endograft manufacturer, with TAG combinations leading to consistently higher loads than Valiant, but independent of chimney graft type. Endograft deformations were dependent on chimney graft type, with Viabahn combinations presenting with lower gutter areas and increased lumen compression than BeGraft.  Chimney graft deformations were also influenced by deployment arrangement in the case of double ch-TEVAR. This study emphasizes the significant variability in both radial loads and mechanical deformations between clinically relevant ch-TEVAR configurations.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f08cb090aa099004e15922a/,75,https://engrxiv.org/3zx2b/,10.31224/osf.io/3zx2b,,2020-07-11T14:05:50.378664,2020-07-11T14:06:16.712835
qypj7,"PLUCK TESTS ON OPERATING DEEPWATER PIPELINE SPANS","Key uncertainties in the assessment of subsea pipeline spans for fatigue due to vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) are the effective axial force, the soil spring stiffness, and the soil damping.  To reduce these uncertainties, pluck tests have been carried out, to determine the natural frequency and damping of single and multiple spans.  These are carried out by pulling the span laterally at midspan with the ROV, until a 6mm or 8mm PP rope that serves as a weak link in the connection from the pipeline and the ROV breaks.  The free vibrations resulting from this pluck are measured with accelerometers attached to the pipeline. 
The paper presents selected results from these tests and their interpretation in terms modal frequencies and damping ratios. Already at the achieved amplitudes of vibration of up to about 0.01D, the results already show considerable nonlinearity and inelasticity that is thought to come from the soil supporting the pipe at the shoulders of the span, and can be captured in FE models by making the soil springs nonlinear and inelastic.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f086bbfa420910079c19ce8/,31,https://engrxiv.org/qypj7/,10.31224/osf.io/qypj7,,2020-07-10T14:52:24.712261,2020-07-10T14:52:44.631963
d3jbr,"Development of a novel test method to investigate mode II fracture and dissection of arteries","The current study presents the development and implementation of a novel experimental technique to generate and characterise mode II crack initiation and propagation in arterial tissue. The current study begins with a demonstration that lap-shear testing of arterial tissue results in mixed mode fracture, rather than mode II. We perform a detailed computational design of a novel experimental method (which we refer to as a shear fracture ring test (SFRT)) to robustly and repeatably generate mode II crack initiation and propagation in arteries. This method is based on generating a localised region of high shear adjacent to a cylindrical loading bar. Placement of a radial notch in this region of high shear stress is predicted to result in a kinking of the crack during a mode II initiation and propagation of the crack over a long distance in the c-direction along the c-a plane. Fabrication and experimental implementation of the SFRT on excised ovine aorta specimens confirms that the novel test method results in pure mode II initiation and propagation. We demonstrate that the mode II fracture strength along the c-a plane is eight times higher than the corresponding mode I strength determined from a standard peel test. We also calibrate the mode II fracture energy based on our measurement of crack propagation rates. The mechanisms of fracture uncovered in the current study, along with our quantification of mode II fracture properties have significant implications for current understanding of the biomechanical conditions underlying aortic dissection.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f0763e158a9e700577e31db/,50,https://engrxiv.org/d3jbr/,10.31224/osf.io/d3jbr,,2020-07-10T01:48:42.410600,2020-07-10T01:49:00.827178

Exploitation of redundancy among sensor signals can help improving the precision of measured variables, detecting the presence of gross errors, and identifying faulty sensors. The cost of sensor ownership, maintenance efforts in particular, can still be cost-prohibitive however. Maximizing the ability to assess and control data quality while minimizing the cost of ownership thus requires a careful sensor placement.

Currently, many different PFAS (on the order of several thousands) are used in a wide range of applications and there is no comprehensive source of information on the many individual substances and their functions in different applications. Here we provide a broad overview of many use categories where PFAS have been employed and for which function; we also specify which PFAS have been used and discuss the magnitude of the uses. Our compilation is not exhaustive, but it was still possible to demonstrate that PFAS are used in almost all industry branches and many consumer products. In total, more than 200 use categories and subcategories were identified for more than 1400 individual PFAS. The identified use categories include many categories not previously described in the scientific literature but also a lot of well-known categories such as textile impregnation, fire-fighting foam, and electroplating.

4nrs6,"An H/V Geostatistical Approach for Building Pseudo-3D Vs Models to Account for Spatial Variability in Ground Response Analyses II: Application to 1D Analyses at Two Downhole Array Sites","Common procedures used to account for spatial variability of shear wave velocity (Vs) in one-dimensional (1D) ground response analyses (GRAs), such as stochastic randomization of Vs or increasing small-strain damping, have been shown to improve seismic site response predictions relative to 1D GRAs where no attempts are made to account for spatial variability. However, even after attempting to account for spatial variability using common procedures, 1D GRAs often still yield results that are different than ground motions recorded at many downhole array sites. When 1D predictions differ from observations, the site is typically considered to be too spatially variable to effectively use 1D GRAs. While there is no doubt that some sites are indeed too variable for 1D GRAs, it is also possible that simple 1D analyses could still be effectively used at many sites if spatial variability is accounted for via a more rational, site-specific approach. In this study, an H/V geostatistical approach for building pseudo-3D Vs models is implemented to account for spatial variability in 1D GRAs. The geostatistical approach is used to generate a uniform grid of Vs profiles that have been scaled to match fundamental site frequency estimates from horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (H/V) noise measurements. In this paper, 1D GRAs are performed for each grid-point and the results are statistically combined to reflect the average site response and its variability. This 1D application is demonstrated at the Treasure Island and Delaney Park Downhole Array sites, where it is shown to produce superior fits to the small-strain recorded site response relative to existing approaches used to account for spatial variability in 1D GRAs. Using the proposed approach, we also investigate the lateral area that is likely influencing site response at each site and show that it could extend to significant distances (as much as 1 km) from the boreholes.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f0496523e18460088c923ce/,64,https://engrxiv.org/4nrs6/,10.31224/osf.io/4nrs6,,2020-07-07T19:10:23.579178,2020-07-21T02:36:19.783714
42yw9,"An H/V Geostatistical Approach for Building Pseudo-3D Vs Models to Account for Spatial Variability in Ground Response Analyses I: Model Development","Many recent studies have shown that we are generally unable to accurately replicate recorded ground motions at most borehole array sites using available subsurface geotechnical information and one-dimensional (1D) ground response analyses (GRAs). When 1D GRAs fail to accurately predict recorded site response, the site is often considered too complex to be effectively modeled as 1D. While 3D numerical GRAs are possible and believed to be more accurate, there is rarely a 3D subsurface model available for these analyses. The lack of affordable and reliable site characterization methods to quantify spatial variability in subsurface conditions, particularly regarding shear wave velocity (Vs) measurements needed for GRAs, has pushed researchers to adopt stochastic approaches, such as Vs randomization and spatially correlated random fields. However, these stochastically generated models require the assumption of generic, or assumed, input parameters, introducing significant uncertainties into the site response predictions. This paper describes a new geostatistical approach that can be used for building pseudo-3D Vs models as a means to rationally account for spatial variability in GRAs, increase model accuracy, and reduce uncertainty. Importantly, it requires only a single measured Vs profile and a number of simple, cost-effective, horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (H/V) noise measurements. Using Gaussian geostatistical regression, irregularly sampled estimates of fundamental site frequency from H/V measurements (f0,H/V) are used to generate a uniform grid of f0,H/V across the site with accompanying Vs profiles that have been scaled to match each f0,H/V value, thereby producing a pseudo-3D Vs model. This approach is demonstrated at the Treasure Island and Delaney Park Downhole Array sites (TIDA and DPDA, respectively). While the pseudo-3D Vs models can be used to incorporate spatial variability into 1D, 2D, or 3D GRAs, their implementation in 1D GRAs at TIDA and DPDA is discussed in a companion paper.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f04951b1484ac007d66d1c5/,113,https://engrxiv.org/42yw9/,10.31224/osf.io/42yw9,,2020-07-07T19:09:23.326231,2020-07-21T02:35:01.355252
wj9v5,"An Iterative Run-to-Run Learning Model to Derive Continuous Brachial Pressure Estimates from Arterial and Venous Lines During Dialysis Treatment","Objective: Non-invasive continuous blood pressure monitoring is not yet part of routine practice in renal dialysis units but could be a valuable tool in the detection and prevention of significant variations in patient blood pressure during treatment. Feasibility studies have delivered an initial validation of a method which utilises pressure sensors in the extra-corporeal dialysis circuit, without any direct contact with the person receiving treatment. Our main objective is to further develop this novel methodology from its current early development status to a continuous-time brachial artery pressure estimator.
Method: During an in vivo patient feasibility study with concurrent measurement validation by Finapres Nova experimental physiological measurement device, real-time continuous dialysis line pressures, and intermittent occluding arm cuff pressure data were collected over the entire period of (typically 4-hour) dialysis treatments. There was found to be an underlying quasi-linear relationship between arterial line and brachial pressure measurements which supported the development of a mathematical function to describe the relationship between arterial dialysis line pressure and brachial artery BP. However, unmodelled non-linearities, dynamics and time-varying parameters present challenges to the development of an accurate BP estimation system. In this paper, we start to address the problem of physiological parameter time variance by novel application of an iterative learning run-to-run modeling methodology originally developed for process control engineering applications to a parameterised BP model.
Results: The iterative run-to-run learning methodology was applied to the real-time data measured during an observational study in 9 patients, supporting subsequent development of an adaptive real-time BP estimator. Tracking of patient BP is analysed for all the subjects in our patient study, supported only by intermittent updates from BP cuff measurements. 
Conclusion: The methodology and associated technology is shown to be capable of tracking patient BP non-invasively via arterial line pressure measurement during complete 4-hour treatment sessions. A robust and tractable method is demonstrated, and future refinements to the approach are defined.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f044c2e6cbca30070d366a1/,34,https://engrxiv.org/wj9v5/,10.31224/osf.io/wj9v5,,2020-07-07T19:07:22.241725,2020-07-08T12:18:16.067391

As such, polymeric materials are known for cracking and low fatigue life. Early studies on the twist-flex behavior of polymer thin films in liquid nitrogen resulted in complete shattering of films after a few cycles. To improve upon this failure behavior, we fabricated thin-film origami bellows with Yoshimura and Kresling geometries to primarily restrict strain to below the elastic limit. We found the resulting bellows survived 100 full compression and extension cycles in liquid nitrogen. No tears or pinholes were detected in the bellows. These results indicate that restricting the strain modes in thin-film polymers via origami structures could lead to a new class of cryogenic technologies useful for liquid storage bladders, expandable seals, positive displacement fluid pumps, and flexible electronics.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f028ea3ea59af01acd37532/,46,https://engrxiv.org/7jdvn/,10.31224/osf.io/7jdvn,,2020-07-06T18:44:36.524975,2020-07-06T18:45:05.659401

By evaporation of a colloidal solution, persistent deposits are readily formed with approx. 10-μm thickness on a 6-μm-thick poly(ethylene-terephthalate) (PET) substrate with a 20-μm diameter microhole. When immersed in aqueous solution, the titanate nanosheets exhibit a p.z.c. of − 37 mV, consistent with the formation of a cation conducting (semi-permeable) deposit. With a sufficiently low ionic strength in the aqueous electrolyte, ionic current rectification is observed (cationic diode behaviour). Currents can be dissected into (i) electrolyte cation transport, (ii) electrolyte anion transport and (iii) water heterolysis causing additional proton transport. For all types of electrolyte cations, a water heterolysis mechanism is observed. For Ca2+ and Mg2+ions, water heterolysis causes ion current blocking, presumably due to localised hydroxide-induced precipitation processes. Aqueous NBu4+ is shown to ‘invert’ the diode effect (from cationic to anionic diode).

We are entering a new era in automation, where AWS or Azure cloud based IoT solutions are being used to automate stock inventory management and retail.

2dytg,"Medical technology innovation for a sustainable impact in Low- and Middle-Income countries: a holistic approach.","Technologies that have been designed for use in high-income countries often fail to deliver their full potential when transposed to Low and Middle-Income Contexts (LMICs). The health sector is a case in point, as medical devices, whether donated or purchased, are generally short lived in those contexts. The mismatch between needs and available solutions originates from the inadequacy of both the technology and the business models. Essential medical technologies such as oxygen concentrators, neonatal incubators, anesthesia machines or diagnostic X-ray systems are classic examples. The case of diagnostic X-ray imaging is particularly striking: 125 years after its invention, up to two thirds of the world population still does not have access to radiology services, according to the World Health Organisation. This is despite the fact that X-ray radiology is one of the cornerstone of healthcare and a crucial instrument for diagnosing a variety of health issues ranging from trauma to tuberculosis and other lung diseases.
We are presenting an integrated methodological approach, to develop innovative solutions adapted to the context of LMICs. The approach relies on three crucial pillars: cooperation, interdisciplinarity and entrepreneurship with a long-term sustainability perspective. We propose a set of four complementary tools that increase the chances of successfully developing and deploying the technologies at scale. The tools, while very practical, allow striking a balance between economic viability, environmental and social impact. We illustrate the use of these tools with the case of diagnostic X-ray imaging. 
We propose that using the approach and tools presented here could allow to rethink other complex technologies that have the potential to address social challenges, in the perspective of making them suitable for LMICs. We also believe that this approach to developing solutions addressing the needs of poorer communities, may lead to better products in industrialized contexts as well.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eff55dbbee6650150f98ea7/,112,https://engrxiv.org/2dytg/,10.31224/osf.io/2dytg,,2020-07-04T13:53:31.393817,2020-07-04T13:53:40.532973

However, CNT characteristics, dispersion procedure and matrix composition/hydration are critical and correlated with a high degree of uncertainty in achieving a desirable performance. This paper proposes a mechanics-based model to predict the elastic modulus of CNT reinforced cementitious materials based on the Halpin-Tsai equation.  The current study employs a probabilistic approach to consider the influences of multiple experimental variables and various sources of uncertainty associated with them. To this end, first, a Bayesian methodology is adopted to perform the model validation, evaluation and selection procedures using extensive literature test data. Then, the optimum ranges of variables are found to maximize the chance of achieving a certain target modulus (herein, 50% more than control) using a reliability analysis. The results indicate that the experimentally observed elastic modulus and the proposed probabilistic model exhibit a similar trend.

A parametric study is then performed to evaluate the influence of length, width and thickness of CFRP laminates on the composite connection performance. In addition, the feasibility of decreasing the reinforcement bar ratios in the presence of the CFRP laminate is investigated. The numerical analysis reveals that the flexural resistance of the retrofitted CFRP strengthened composite connection increases by up to around 20% and the rotation capacity decreases by approximately 60%.

f4bvp,"Approximating unstable operation speeds of automatic ball balancers based on design parameters","Automatic balancers present a modular possibility to counteract variable rotor unbalances during operation. Two or more balancing masses, usually spheres, can orbit in a fluid-filled annular cavity whose axis of symmetry coincides with the rotor axis. At supercritical speeds the masses -- driven by the rotor deflection -- tend towards stationary positions inside the cavity opposing the primary rotor unbalance.
Related to the phenomenon of rotating shafts being captured at resonances due to insufficient drive power, automatic ball balancers inhibit operation speed bands with non-synchronous vibrations where the rotor surpassed the resonance but the balls continue to orbit with the eigenfrequency with respect to the inertial system. As a result, the balancing masses do not take stationary positions inside the cavity and the rotor is excited not only by the primary unbalance but also by the sub-synchronously orbiting balancing masses.
The width of the operation speed band exhibiting non-synchronous behaviour depends on the balancing masses, the orbit radius, external damping of the rotor and viscous damping of the balls due to the fluid inside the cavity. For a planar oscillator in isotropic supports with a balancer containing two balancing balls, an explicit correlation between the stability border and the fluid damping is presented. In order to parameterize the fluid damping model, the drag on spheres in annular cavities is examined and a proposed relation based on the cavity geometry and the fluid properties is presented.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ef9ab339fceff011d82f29b/,35,https://engrxiv.org/f4bvp/,10.31224/osf.io/f4bvp,,2020-06-29T15:49:38.119308,2020-06-30T06:24:27.879604
s43zg,"Building decarbonisation transition pathways","The problem of decarbonising heating in buildings has been studied for more than 20 years, but there is still no settled consensus on strategy or choice of technology. 
There is consensus that the problem requires analysis of the whole energy system. Recent literature based on whole system analysis appears to indicate that heat pumps are likely offer the cheapest decarbonisation option overall, achieving an immediate factor of three reduction in emissions, with the promise of close to zero emissions by 2030, as a consequence of a phenomenon that now appears unstoppable – the decarbonisation of electricity generation. 
Though some dwellings would also benefit from additional insulation to increase health and comfort, the overall role of insulation in decarbonisation is likely to be secondary. High levels of insulation are not essential to the deployment of heat pumps and are only likely to be cost effective in easy-to-treat properties. 
But technology choice is not an either-or question. Combinations of technology, such as hybrid heat pumps, and deployment of large heat pumps in district heating systems, offer obvious advantages. And if the role of hydrogen as a vector for supplying heat to individual homes appears limited on overall cost grounds, hydrogen or hydrogen-derived fuels are likely to play a strategic role in providing backup for the electricity grid at multiple levels, including the very long-term energy storage that will be needed from about 2040 onwards. 
Sifting through the multiple combinations and configurations of technologies that are, and will become available over the coming 30 years will be an on-going activity. In this context, a key recent development is an understanding of the need to complement conventional energy modelling with the tools of System Architecture.

9f5pj,"Connecting lignin gasification with syngas fermentation","The development of lignin derived energy products is one way to increase the value of biorefinery residues, which is the scope of the EU project AMBITION. Gasification of (lignin-rich) biorefinery residues, followed by product gas cleaning and anaerobic fermentation, offers a potential to produce higher added-value products such as biofuels and chemicals.  
MILENA indirect gasification allows complete fuel conversion and produces a high value gas composed of CO, H2 and CO2, as well as compounds such as CH4, C2-C4 gases, benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX). The separation of the most valuable components of the product gas is a good way to maximize the value from the feedstock via co-production schemes. The product gas, after appropriate cleaning to remove impurities that can reduce the fermentability of syngas, can be applied in the gas fermentation process. 
Some anaerobic microorganisms, known as acetogens, can be used as a biocatalyst for the conversion of syngas into short-chain organic acids and alcohols, like acetate, ethanol, butanol, butan-2,3-diol and butyric acid. The ability of these microorganisms to withstand some of the impurities contained in the syngas and their flexibility to use different mixtures of CO and/or CO2 and H2 makes these bacteria an attractive alternative to the chemical catalytic processes. 
Despite these advantages, the integration of gasification with syngas fermentation is still in an early stage of development, where many questions exist concerning the syngas quality needed in the fermentation process. The challenge is to define the optimum gasification conditions for this type of feedstock that will provide a H2:CO:CO2 ratio at values suitable for syngas fermentation, as well as to identify and remove the compounds that can inhibit the performance of the microorganisms. In this work a first attempt to combine the two processes is presented.
A lignin rich feedstock was gasified with steam at 780°C using MILENA indirect gasifier, at TNO. The product gas after removal of the main impurities, consisted of CO, H2, CO2, N2, CH4 and traces of other gaseous hydrocarbons, benzene and H2S. The influence of the obtained syngas quality and composition was evaluated in the fermentation process, at KIT. For comparison, product gas from beech wood gasification after cleaning was also evaluated in the fermentation process under the same conditions.
The process involved growing cells in a batch system under continuous flow of biomass-derived gas. The strain used in this work is Clostridium ljungdahlii.

s9kj4,"A Software Method For Mitigating Single Qubit Errors On Superconducting Quantum Devices","Quantum error correction schemes have gained a lot of attention in recent years. This is due to the emergence of small scale quantum devices that make use of superconducting qubits. However these devices are noisy and prone to quantum decoherence and thus errors. Along with quantum error correction there has been a push for new schemes in quantum error mitigation that take a more passive approach in eliminating readout errors. In this research we introduce a software method for quantum error mitigation that maps virtual qubits in a circuit to physical qubits with the least error. The method developed was tested on 9 IBM quantum devices. Results in the study have shown the method can reduce readout errors by up to 35.52%.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ef26cdd6598280250cf1432/,83,https://engrxiv.org/s9kj4/,10.31224/osf.io/s9kj4,,2020-06-24T14:16:17.189138,2020-06-24T14:16:45.823074
3sdfa,"Complex Deep Learning Models for Denoising of Human Heart ECG signals","Effective and powerful methods for denoising real electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are important for wearable sensors and devices. Deep Learning (DL) models have been used extensively in image processing and other domains with great success but only very recently have been used in processing ECG signals. This paper presents several DL models namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) together with the more conventional filtering methods (low pass filtering, high pass filtering, Notch filtering) and the standard wavelet-based technique for denoising EEG signals.  These methods are trained, tested and evaluated on different synthetic and real ECG datasets taken from the MIT PhysioNet database and for different simulation conditions (i.e. various lengths of the ECG signals, single or multiple records). The results show the CNN model is a performant model that can be used for off-line denoising ECG applications where it is satisfactory to train on a clean part of an ECG signal from an ECG record, and then to test on the same ECG signal, which would have some high level of noise added to it.   However,  for real-time applications or near-real time applications, this task becomes more cumbersome, as the clean part of an ECG signal is very probable to be very limited in size. Therefore the solution put forth in this work is to train a CNN model on 1 second ECG noisy artificial multiple heartbeat data (i.e. ECG at effort), which was generated in a first instance based on few sequences of real signal heartbeat ECG data (i.e. ECG at rest).  Afterwards it would be possible to use the trained CNN model in real life situations to denoise the ECG signal. This corresponds also to reality, where usually the human is put at rest and the ECG is recorded and then the same human is asked to do some physical exercises and the ECG is recorded at effort. The quality of results is assessed visually but also by using the Root Mean Squared (RMS) and the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) measures. All CNN models used an NVIDIA TITAN V Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) with 12 GB RAM, which reduces drastically the computational times. Finally, as an element of novelty, the paper presents also a Design of Experiment (DoE) study which intends to determine the optimal structure of a CNN model, which type of study has not been seen in the literature before.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ef1f03665982801fccf63a6/,29,https://engrxiv.org/3sdfa/,10.31224/osf.io/3sdfa,,2020-06-23T13:32:45.462982,2020-06-23T13:59:11.725022
u2wfh,"On copper removal from aquatic media using simultaneous and sequential iron-perlite composites","The use of reusable, affordable, and inert adsorbents as a means to mitigate copper pollution, with a lesser burden on the environment, has been attracting some attention. However, aiding the adsorption process of a promising adsorbent, such as expanded volcanic glass (perlite), with a reducing companion, such as solid iron, that can displace and dispose of copper from polluted water has never been tested before. In this laboratory study, we investigated the removal of Cu2+, resulting from contaminating freshwater with copper sulphate pentahydrate, using simultaneous or non-simultaneous (sequential) mixes of expanded perlite and iron coarse powder over 23 hours. The percentage of copper removed was calculated at 15 min, 40 min, 120 min, 300 min, and 1380 min using induced coupled plasma (ICP-OES). A rapid removal of 71% at 120 min was achieved when the perlite and iron were added simultaneously in separate permeable pouches; the application of the iron after the perlite led to 78% of removal at 1380 min that was almost identical to what was accrued via perlite alone (77%). This, therefore, suggests that the presence of iron is most advantageous in the short run as it leads to fast uptake of  Cu2+, attributable to the combined action of the reduction of  Cu2+ by iron and  Cu2+ adsorption by perlite. Further investigation in support of the results was carried out using Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDAX), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET), and Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The findings of this multidisciplinary work provide insights and mechanisms for heavy metal removal from water in a relatively short time using a novel time-specific combination of iron and perlite and thus merit wider testing across different classes of adsorbents, pollutants, and water systems.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ef1ee3665982801ffcf78e2/,38,https://engrxiv.org/u2wfh/,10.31224/osf.io/u2wfh,,2020-06-24T14:15:35.015227,2020-06-24T14:16:02.048746

r49a7,"Anisotropic and viscoelastic tensile mechanical properties of aponeurosis: Experimentation, modeling, and tissue microstructure","poneuroses are stiff sheath-like components of the muscle-tendon unit that play a vital role in force transmission and thus locomotion. There is clear importance of the aponeurosis in musculoskeletal function, but there have been relatively few studies of aponeurosis material properties to date. The goals of this work were to: 1) perform tensile stress-relaxation tests, 2) perform planar biaxial tests, 3) employ computational modeling to the data from 1 to 2, and 4) perform scanning electron microscopy to determine collagen fibril organization for aponeurosis tissue. Viscoelastic modeling and statistical analysis of stress-relaxation data showed that while relaxation rate differed statistically between strain levels (p = 0.044), functionally the relaxation behavior was nearly the same. Biaxial testing and associated modeling highlighted the nonlinear (toe region of ~2–3% strain) and anisotropic (longitudinal direction linear modulus ~50 MPa, transverse ~2.5 MPa) tensile mechanical behavior of aponeurosis tissue. Comparisons of various constitutive formulations showed that a transversely isotropic Ogden approach balanced strong fitting (goodness of fit 0.984) with a limited number of parameters (five), while damage modeling parameters were also provided. Scanning electron microscopy showed a composite structure of highly aligned, partially wavy collagen fibrils with more random collagen cables for aponeurosis microstructure.

We investigated this effect through the lens of asset utilisation, cost and the social disruption caused by accelerating RE into the Indian Power System. Our analysis revealed that increasing RE generation is pushing the coal plants to operate in low-loading conditions, causing heightened wear and tear of the plant as they are not suitable for flexible operation. The novel analysis of social disruption due to market parity between RES and coal-based generation presented a holistic view of the political economy of Indian Power System. We found that transition from coal to RE may have extended socio-political ramifications that can potentially disrupt the national economy at an unprecedented scale. Policy implications outlined by our study for the draft Electricity (Amendment) Bill 2020 include scoping a socio-technical framework which supports just energy transition through better financial support mechanisms for flexible operation of coal plants.

dt8fs,"Human Trafficking Interdiction with Decision Dependent Success","This paper presents a bi-level network interdiction model to increase the effectiveness of attempting to disrupt a human trafficking network under a resource constrained environment. To model the behavior of the trafficker, we present a new interpretation of the traditional maximum flow network problem in which the arc capacity parameter serves as a proxy for the trafficker's desirability to travel along segments of the network. The objective for the anti-human trafficking stakeholder is to invest resources in detection and intervention efforts throughout the network in a manner that  minimizes the trafficker's expected maximum desirability of operating on the network.  Interdictions are binary, and their effects are stochastic (i.e., there is a positive probability that a disruption attempt is unsuccessful). A multi-stage version of the model is presented, which incorporates the effect of interdictions becoming more or less successful over time. Model insights are presented using a case study of the road network in the Eastern Development Region of Nepal. Multiple problem instances are solved with a genetic algorithm that uses a pseudo-utility ratio for the repair operation. Observations regarding the impact of probabilistic interdiction success and the implications it has for  optimal policies to disrupt a human trafficking network with limited resources are discussed.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ee7a039c2f677001bad230d/,74,https://engrxiv.org/dt8fs/,10.31224/osf.io/dt8fs,,2020-06-17T20:51:07.085431,2020-06-17T20:51:27.348018

A sharded blockchain achieves parallelism by dividing consensus nodes (validators) into groups called shards and making them process different transactions in each shard. In this paper, we economically analyze users’ behavior on sharded blockchains and identify a phenomenon that users’ accounts and smart contracts eventually get concentrated in a few shards, making shard loads unfair. This phenomenon leads to bad user experiences, such as delays in transaction inclusions and increased transaction fees. To solve the above problem, we propose a load balancing  ramework in sharded blockchains in which accounts and contracts are frequently reassigned into shards to reduce the difference of loads between shards. We formulate the contract reassignment as an optimization problem and present the algorithm to solve it. Further, we apply the framework to an existing sharding design (Ethereum 2.0) and modify the protocol to do load balancing.

n53fx,"Modal Engineering for MEMS Devices: Application to Galvos and Scanners","Optical systems typically use galvanometers (aka galvos) and scanners. Galvos move optical elements such as mirrors, quasi-statically, from one static position to another, and an important figure of merit is their step-settle relaxation time. Scanners move in an oscillatory fashion, typically at the device resonant frequency. MEMS devices, which have many advantages and are often used in such optical systems, are typically high Q devices. Moving from one position to another for a galvo or one frequency/amplitude to another for scanners, can take many periods to settle following the ring down. During these transitions, the optical system is inactive and the time is not being efficiently used. In this article we show how a novel class of open loop control algorithms can be used to rapidly change position, frequency and amplitude, typically in well under the period of the device.

The analysis of the lay-up optimality conditions (derived earlier) for buckling optimization of VAT composite plates is performed.

f27d9,"Light-years apart: Energy usage by schools across the South African affluence divide","South Africa’s source of energy in buildings is electricity from a struggling state utility running mainly on coal. But despite the constraints and the high cost, energy usage remains mostly unchecked and poorly managed in schools, whose attention is focused on reducing inequality in educational outcomes. School energy usages have been well studied in many countries but remain largely unexplored in South Africa. We use smart electricity meters to analyse the energy requirements of 16 schools across the country’s polarised affluence spectrum. Comparing their usage with that of schools from other countries, we find that the affluent South African schools have energy densities of 13% as much as those in North America, compared to the poor schools with a mere 5%. We observe a large difference between the daily usage profiles of poor and affluent schools: poor schools used only 40% of the energy used by affluent schools. We ascribe this disparity to constrained infrastructure investment at the poor schools. We identified lighting as a major contributor to energy usage by schools, accounting for as much as 32% of the daily in-term usage by affluent schools and 21 to 65% by poor schools, compared to 14 to 25% in developed countries. Since most schools still use fluorescent lights, substantial savings can be achieved by replacing them with efficient LED lights.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ee081293099210037a063ef/,69,https://engrxiv.org/f27d9/,10.31224/osf.io/f27d9,10.1016/j.erss.2020.101692,2020-06-11T13:16:43.785567,2020-07-30T04:13:50.930132

zhs53,"A reduced order computational model of a semi-active variable-stiffness foot prosthesis","INTRODUCTION: Passive energy storage and return (ESR) feet are the current performance standard in lower limb prostheses. A recently developed semi-active variable-stiffness foot (VSF) prosthesis balances the simplicity of a passive ESR device with the adaptability of a powered design. The purpose of this study was to model and simulate the ESR properties of the VSF prosthesis. METHODS: The ESR properties of the VSF were modeled as a lumped parameter overhung beam. The overhung length is variable, allowing the model to exhibit variable ESR stiffness. Foot-ground contact was modeled using sphere-to-plane contact models. Contact parameters were optimized to represent the geometry and dynamics of the VSF and its foam base. Static compression tests and gait were simulated. Simulation outcomes were compared to corresponding experimental data. RESULTS: Stiffness of the model matched that of the physical VSF (R2: 0.98, RMSE: 1.37 N/mm). Model-predicted resultant ground reaction force (GRFR) matched well under optimized parameter conditions (R2: 0.98, RMSE: 5.3% body weight,) and unoptimized parameter conditions (R2: 0.90, mean RMSE: 13% body weight). Anterior-posterior center of pressure matched well with R2 &gt; 0.94 and RMSE &lt; 9.5% foot length in all conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The ESR properties of the VSF were accurately simulated under benchtop testing and dynamic gait conditions. These methods may be useful for predicting GRFR arising from gait with novel prostheses. Such data are useful to optimize prosthesis design parameters on a user-specific basis.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5edfcc4c8b542601db8b5feb/,58,https://engrxiv.org/zhs53/,10.31224/osf.io/zhs53,,2020-06-09T20:35:54.341814,2020-06-09T20:36:22.086418

The purpose of such schemes is to ensure that only a legitimate user and no one else access the rendered services. Examples of such applications include secure access to buildings, computer systems, laptops, cellular phones, and ATMs. Face can be used as Biometrics for person verification. Face is a complex multidimensional structure and needs a good computing techniques for recognition. We treats face recognition as a two-dimensional recognition problem. A well-known technique of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used for face recognition. Face images are projected onto a face space that encodes best variation among known face images. The face space is defined by Eigen face which are eigenvectors of the set of faces, which may not correspond to general facial features such as eyes, nose, lips. The system performs by projecting pre extracted face image onto a set of face space that represent significant variations among known face images. The variable reducing theory of PCA accounts for the smaller face space than the training set of face. A Multire solution features based pattern recognition system used for face recognition based on the combination of Radon and wavelet transforms. As the Radon transform is in-variant to rotation and a Wavelet Transform provides the multiple resolution. This technique is robust for face recognition. The technique computes Radon projections in different orientations and captures the directional features of face images. Further, the wavelet transform applied on Radon space provides multire solution features of the facial images. Being the line integral, Radon transform improves the low-frequency components that are useful in face recognition",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5edf1c8b08aad3016443ea02/,26,https://engrxiv.org/75qba/,10.31224/osf.io/75qba,,2020-06-17T19:55:19.597952,2020-06-17T19:55:42.048229

Especially during the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need to build the global testing capacity up to 100-fold above what is achievable with current standard approaches. However, current gold standard methods such as RT-PCR and isothermal PCR (e.g., RT-LAMP), which are routinely conducted in laboratories, suffer from limit capacity due to the requirement of special equipment, multiple sample handling steps, and/or the need of skilled personnel. In this study, a kitchen Range Oven enabled RT-LAMP was conducted at a residential home without sacrificing the performance in RNA detection. In addition, one-step, closed-tube RT-LAMP for the detection of target RNA in the oven was accomplished by pre-loading sample collection solution and RT-LAMP reaction reagents into the bottom and cap cavity of PCR tube, respectively. After the addition of target RNA into sample collection solution through either swab swirling or direct pipetting, a flip-and-swing enabled mixing of sample solution and RT-LAMP reaction reagents was conducted first, followed by RT-LAMP detection at a constant temperature in pre-heated oven. The RNA positive sample can be obviously differentiated from the RNA negative sample through both naked-eye based turbidity detection and fluorescence detection under UV light. In conjunction with the user-friendly one-step, closed-tube concept, this study indicates that it is feasible to run RT-LAMP at home using oven with minimum involvement of end-users, thus offering an excellent molecular detection platform, which has the potential to boost the detection capacity for any nucleic acid target. It could be a potential solution for large-scale screening of COVID-19 in short time as the tests can be conducted by residents at home, without the need of well-trained health caregivers and capacity limitation.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eda7d8508aad3005a43defe/,134,https://engrxiv.org/ed85s/,10.31224/osf.io/ed85s,,2020-06-06T14:08:26.432303,2020-06-06T14:08:42.330447

bxvgz,"Feasibility and Performance Analysis of Neptune Aerocapture Using Heritage Blunt Body Aeroshells (Pre-print)","Large navigation and atmospheric uncertainties have historically driven the need for a mid-lift-to-drag L/D vehicle with L/D of 0.6--0.8 for aerocapture at Neptune. Most planetary entry vehicles flown to date are low-L/D blunt-body aeroshells with L/D less than 0.4. The lack of a heritage mid-L/D aeroshell presents a major hurdle for Neptune aerocapture, as the development a new entry vehicle incurs significant time and investment. Techniques which may allow Neptune aerocapture to be feasible using heritage low-L/D blunt-body aeroshells are investigated that obviate the need for mid-L/D aeroshells. A navigation study is performed to quantify the delivery errors, and a new guidance algorithm with onboard density estimation is developed to accommodate large atmospheric uncertainties.

In this study, we successfully developed a second-generation composite using a heterogenous mixture of thermoset and thermoplastic recycled carbon fiber composites (CFCs). The recovered vinyl ester and epoxy CFCs were characterized using thermogravimetric analysis. Adhesive performance was evaluated through double lap shear tests by melt-bonding a thermoplastic polyether ether ketone (PEEK) CFC to either the thermoset epoxy or vinyl ester CFC. The waste carbon fiber composites were also mechanically milled and classified through screening techniques. The resulting milled materials were used to form and produce composite panels through high temperature compression molding. The influence of particle size and platen temperature were evalauted through mechanical testing. Results indicate that melt-bonding with the vinyl ester/CFC exhibited significantly higher lap shear strength values than that between epoxy/CFC and PEEK. Findings also show that adding thermoset CFCs to the thermoplastic system (PEEK) enhanced the flexural properties of composites.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed962a808aad3000d43a428/,58,https://engrxiv.org/hmyqx/,10.31224/osf.io/hmyqx,,2020-06-05T15:36:27.917394,2020-06-05T15:37:07.551280

The purpose of this study was to assess the validity of CT-based virtual mechanical testing with respect to physical biomechanical tests in a large animal model. Three different tibial osteotomy models were performed on 44 sheep. Data from 33 operated limbs and 20 intact limbs was retrospectively analyzed. Radiographic union scoring was performed on the operated limbs and physical torsional tests were performed on all limbs. Morphometric measures and finite element (FE) models were developed from CT scans and virtual torsional tests were performed with four different material assignment techniques. In correlation analysis, morphometric measures and radiographic scores were unreliable predictors of biomechanical rigidity, while the virtual torsion test results were strongly and significantly correlated with measured biomechanical test data, with high absolute agreement. Overall, the results validated the use of virtual mechanical testing as a reliable in vivo assessment of structural bone healing. This method is readily translatable to clinical evaluation for noninvasive assessment of the healing progress of fractures with minimal risk. Clinical significance: Virtual mechanical testing can be used to reliably and non-invasively assess the rigidity of a healing fracture using clinical-resolution CT scans and that this measure is superior to morphometric and radiographic measures.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed92c5f748b0b0058872b37/,56,https://engrxiv.org/28xgn/,10.31224/osf.io/28xgn,,2020-06-05T15:27:22.386449,2020-06-05T15:27:41.301086
z9fs2,"The mechanism of vortex bifurcation vis-à-vis axial switching in rectangular synthetic jets","The present study investigates the vortex dynamics of the rectangular shaped synthetic jet and reports the occurrence of vortex ring bifurcation along with other reported modes such as axial switching and the vortex suction. The novel finding of vortex ring bifurcation of rectangular synthetic jets has been observed without any other mode of excitation except the periodic axial actuation. The experiments on synthetic jets have been conducted at different actuation frequencies and both qualitative and quantitative characterization of the flow structures has been carried out using Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) and Laser Doppler Velocimetry, respectively. LIF flow visualization provides insights into the size of the vortex and the vortex evolution with respect to time, enabling us to propose the flow physics behind the axial switching and the vortex bifurcation processes for rectangular synthetic jets. The proposed flow physics is then quantitatively evidenced by the time-averaged velocity measurements. Vortex splitting or bifurcation is found to occur in the minor axis plane of orifice and the divergence angle depends on the actuation frequency and average velocity of fluid expelled through the orifice in the forward stroke of diaphragm. In the case of occurrence of axial switching, a maximum of three axial switching events are observed before vortex breakup. Finally, by systematically carrying out experiments across a wide range of operational parameters, a narrow region corresponding to the vortex bifurcation has been identified on a Reynolds Number-Strouhal Number map, along with other modes such as axial switching regime and the vortex suction regime. Based on our measurements, a mechanism of vortex bifurcation vis-à-vis axial switching has also been suggested.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed8ad00748b0b00298731bd/,44,https://engrxiv.org/z9fs2/,10.31224/osf.io/z9fs2,,2020-06-17T19:53:00.139232,2020-06-17T19:53:22.439365
8ujyr,"Effects of combination of retarders on calcium sulfoaluminate (CSA) cement systems","One method of increasing the sustainability of concrete construction through reductions in emissions and energy requirements is through the use of alternative binders. Calcium Sulfoaluminate (CSA) cement has been developed as a low energy cement, as it has up to 40% less embodied carbon dioxide emissions due to its lower calcium content and reduced clinkering temperature relative to Portland cement. However, despite the advantages of CSA cement, its rapid setting time limits the use of this material to applications when short working time is required. To facilitate better control of the timing of CSA hardening and strength gain, several approaches to retarder usage and dosing have been studied. In this paper, use of chemical retardants, including citric acid, tartaric acid, and borax with CSA cement used alone and in combination with each other, and their effects on phase development and hardened binder properties were evaluated and discussed in relation to their retardation mechanisms. Because of differing working mechanisms of the retarders, combinations of citric acid and borax showed relationships that averaged the properties of each retarder, while combinations of citric acid and tartaric acid showed relationships that added the effects of the two retarders together. Setting time of CSA cement was delayed successfully, using retarders both alone and in combination, however combination mixes generally decreased compressive strength compared to the strengths of equivalent total singular retarder dosage. Relationships between heat release and setting time were developed and may prove useful for prediction of largescale application field performance.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed7dcd839746400a87a8680/,47,https://engrxiv.org/8ujyr/,10.31224/osf.io/8ujyr,,2020-06-09T16:49:14.948911,2020-06-09T17:06:41.986090

hrgdn,"The effect of a parallel free surface upon a submerged shallow synthetic jet","The interaction of a submerged shallow synthetic jet with a parallel free surface has gathered substantial interest, owing to its relevance to the operation of marine vehicles viz. ships that move close to the water surface. However, despite exhaustive research on the perturbation on a free surface, very few studies have experimentally investigated the effect of unconfined water surface height on the evolution and propagation of a submerged synthetic jet. This study experimentally investigates a synthetic jet submerged in a quiescent flow at shallow depths ejecting parallel to the free surface, through qualitative analysis and quantitative measurements. The qualitative study includes the visualization of the flow using Plane Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) technique, whereas the velocity measurements are carried out by a five-beam Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) probe. The primary objective of these analysis and measurements is to gain a physical insight into the characteristics of vortex ring in a synthetic jet ejected from a fixed orifice at different water depths and at varying Reynolds number. Our studies indicate that the behavior of the vortex rings drastically changes as the depth of the jet crosses a certain threshold. Although no significant change in the path of synthetic jet is observed beyond a threshold depth in our experiments, the jet trajectory shows an interesting dependence on the Reynolds number based on circulation for shallow water depths. It has been found that in the shallow depths, the vortex ring drifts upwards and interacts with the free surface at lower Reynolds number, whereas for larger Reynolds number, the vortex ring rebounds near the free surface and moves downward. Based on our observations, it can be concluded that the phenomenon of upward/downward flection of vortex rings depends both upon its circulation and water depth.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed751ee39746400817a4958/,44,https://engrxiv.org/hrgdn/,10.31224/osf.io/hrgdn,,2020-06-03T15:37:52.932446,2020-06-10T18:44:24.081899
qtbm6,"Optimization of the India Mark II Hand Pump to create maximum cavitation for disinfection of water","The India Mark II hand pump has been modified based on CFD analysis for creating cavitating conditions and is being used to disinfect water that passes and pumped through the pump. Cavitation is created through a restriction in the flow area opening as a function of lift of the check valve. When cavities collapse, they let out a high velocity microjet and a spherical shockwave that, if the former is incident on a cell wall of a microbe, will cause the cell wall to rupture and the microbe will be rendered unviable. Intensity of cavitation has been optimised in the hand pump to give a maximum disinfection.
The flow area opening as a function of lift was restricted by placing a ring of particular width over the check valve. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were used to optimize the dimensions of the ring. ANSYS 16.0 FLUENT was used to simulate the geometry of the India Mark II hand-pump. Simulations showed that the optimum level of cavitation occurred when lift is 60%, with instantaneous cavity collapse pressure of 401 atm. Experiments were carried out to validate the results at a pilot plant installed at ICT. Maximum disinfection of 92% was observed at ring width which gave 60% of flow area similar to that 60% predicted by simulations.

As different nations all across the globe lift the lockdown restrictions and as life springs back to normalcy, organizations, in order to quell the apprehensions and concerns of its workers, may have to institute newer paradigms to curb infection and generate awareness. Prior reported research shows that although an adequately designed health hygiene system may be helpful in curbing the infection spread, a major issue stems from the lack of adherence, by a section of individuals in any institution. In such a situation, it becomes absolutely imperative to track the compliance by different individuals, so that educational interventions may be targeted for the concerned group of workers. Further, currently, no low-cost compact systems exist that can provide for the hand hygiene requirements for a group of people, which are “touch-free”, automated and which are monitored. To bridge this gap, we propose the design and development of an automated monitored hand hygiene system to curb infection spread in institutional settings. It is designed in such a way that it would provide for hand sanitization of four people at a time per machine, simultaneously ensuring social distancing between them.

qwmg6,"Vibration-based Monitoring for Transverse Cooperative Working Performance of Assembled Concrete Multi-Girder Bridge: System Design, Implementation and Preliminary Application","The hinge joints of the assembled concrete multi-girder bridge (ACMGB) are the main components of transverse transmission of loads and the decline of their transmission capacity would lead to the degradation of the transverse cooperative working performance (TCWP) of the multi-beam system. As the key working performance of this kind of bridges, its severe degradation would result in the single-girder-bearing phenomenon inducing bridge collapse.

These monitoring data are then used for identifing transverse mode shape of the multi-beam system and its derivated index in order to evaluate TCWP. This scheme has been implemented on three adjacent ACMGBs in Tongji Road Viaduct in shanghai and the preliminary analysis of monitoring data proves the effectiveness and rationality of the monitoring scheme proposed in this paper, which has the potential of the TCWP evaluation.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed7304fe5cad000622a16ac/,73,https://engrxiv.org/qwmg6/,10.31224/osf.io/qwmg6,,2020-06-03T15:32:14.007060,2020-06-10T18:44:25.718144
4pufw,"On the effect of multi-angle and spatially variable ground motions on cable-stayed bridges","The definition of the Spatial Variability of the Ground Motion (SVGM) is a com- plex and multi-parametric problem. Its effect on the seismic response of long and multiply-supported structures in general, and on cable-stayed bridges, in particular, is important but not entirely understood. This work examines the effect of the SVGM on the seismic response of cable-stayed bridges by means of the time delay of the earth- quake at different supports and of the loss of coherency of the seismic waves. The focus herein is the effect of the SVGM on cable-stayed bridges with various configu- rations in terms of their length and of design parameters, such as the pylon shape and the pylon–cable system configuration, combined with the influence of the incidence angle of the seismic waves. The aim of this paper is to provide general conclusions that are applicable to a wide range of cable-stayed bridges and to contribute to the ongoing effort to interpret and predict the effect of the SVGM. It has been found that the influence of the multi-support excitation on the seismic response of the bridges is strongly affected by the shape of the pylons, by the pylon–cable system configura- tion and by and the earthquake’s incidence angle. It is also observed that the SVGM excites vibration modes of the bridges that do not contribute to their seismic response when identical support motion is considered.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed7104f237cd3005554f6df/,83,https://engrxiv.org/4pufw/,10.31224/osf.io/4pufw,,2020-06-11T13:20:23.838668,2020-06-16T18:14:21.273058

Prior reported research shows that although the usage of masks may be helpful in curbing the infection spread, a major issue stems from the lack of adherence of proper steps in wearing/taking off masks. The users touch their face, ears, eyes, nose etc. after taking off the masks, ultimately making themselves more susceptible to infection, and thus reducing the efficacy of the suggested measure of using masks. The current masks are quite inadequate. It covers only the nose and mouth, leaving room for the users to touch their face, ears, nose and eyes, which are all the vulnerable gates for the infection transmission. The masks are uncomfortable and require regular adjustment, there are problems of humidity build-up inside masks, high chances of leakage, problems with breathing, and one even needs to take off the mask for ingesting liquids, food, medicine etc. even if one is in a community setting or in a crowded region. Further, since these masks provide insufficient protection, there is an additional burden on the supply chain requirements for other personal protective gear. To address these limitations of the commercially available masks, we propose the design of a low-cost COmfortably Vented, Indigenously Designed (COVID) fabric helmet. It is designed in such a way that usage of this cheap helmet along with the usually worn cloth is enough to provide complete protection to an individual. The fabric helmet is integrated with many innovative design features that will not only address the concerns of the users, but will be comfortable, cheap and also ease pressure on the requirement for expensive, and already scarce personal protective equipment and thus greatly curtail COVID-19 infection spread in the country. Most importantly, the prosed design will serve as a very effective device in the protection of the pediatric population in the educational institutions as well as in residential and healthcare settings, as situations spring back to normalcy in communities around the globe.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed6836b39746400207a484b/,89,https://engrxiv.org/3rdc4/,10.31224/osf.io/3rdc4,,2020-06-02T18:04:54.421326,2020-07-11T11:04:48.699266

behavior can be captured by hyperbolic modeling with model parameters involved in
the behavior being initial void ratio, e0, representing the initial state of soil and other
hyperbolic constants linked to this state. The data of 6 samples were used for

cmfd6,"A data-driven approach for constructing a zonal network model for long-term dispatch planning","The most important aspect of the planning of power generation dispatch is its complementary relationship with the power flows on the interconnectors of the transmission network. A plan could become invalid if the power flow created violates the transfer limit of any interconnectors. The long-term dispatch planning is more affected by this because of the relative difficulty in predicting the state of the transmission network in advance. It is generally planned in a trade-based manner, without a means to explicitly compute the power flows. Deviations in the plans are then corrected near the time of dispatch, in the expense of opportunity costs. In Europe, the flow-based market coupling is proposed in the Central Western Europe, which is an effective means for modeling the inter-zonal power flows and transfer capacity allocations. However, its usefulness for long-term planning is still limited. Especially, the Power Transfer Distribution Factors (PTDFs) of its model (key parameter for integrating power flow in dispatch planning) is stochastic and unpredictable. This paper introduces a data-driven approach to construct a zonal model for closing the gap between the long-term and the actual dispatch plan. It is able to reconstruct all zonal PTDFs existed in the system, by inverse modeling the ex-post power flow data. The paper as well presented the validity of decomposing a large zonal model into substantially smaller sub-problems, and the existence of clusters of ex-post power flow cases which share the same zonal PTDFs.

These flight vehicles are generally housed in hollow launch canisters which are used for storage, transportation and launching through mobile launchers. The lateral signature of launch canister is chosen such a way that more number of canisters can be accommodated per one launcher. To accommodate the flight vehicle in launch canister, it is accordingly configured with foldable wings and fins. New designs of flight vehicle, canister and launcher system need to be verified for all the interfaces and the controllability of flight vehicle when it clears the canister. While coming out of canister at low elevation launch angles, the flight vehicle starts deviating from its intended trajectory due to the combination of gravitational force, thrust misalignments, aerodynamic forces, low initial thrust, lateral shift of centre of mass, deployment forces of wing and fin etc. To record actual launch dispersions and to remove any hidden uncertainties in new designs, a live firing with a full scale short duration flight vehicle was undertaken. A propulsion system was specifically designed to function for a small duration simulating the actual thrust time profile of that of the full scale rocket motor system for that initial duration. One short duration rocket motor system was static tested to verify the design parameters and another one was integrated with the rest of the actual flight hardware thus realizing in to a full scale short duration flight vehicle. The geometry, length, weight and centre of mass, launch shoe interfaces etc of short duration flight vehicle was ensured as that of actual full scale flight vehicle.

There are a number of methods such as manually removing the unwanted plants by using traditional hand tools or by spraying chemical weedicides which will kill the weeds or using some mechanical equipment’s. Of the above-mentioned methods, the mechanical weeding is mostly preferred due to its low operating cost and human effort. Moreover, the efficiency of the mechanical weeding process is high when compared with the other methods. In dry land tapioca farms, it is difficult to remove the unwanted weed plants by using the existing weeding equipment’s. In the tapioca farms, the tubers of tapioca are located only few millimeters below the soil surface. The present -day weeding equipment’s remove the weed plants by digging the soil surface and it is not favoured because the process will cause damage to the tubers. The use of chemical weedicides is not preferred due to the hazardous nature of the chemicals. The manual weeding process is also not preferred because of the high labour cost. So, in this project A mechanical equipment for carrying out the weeding process in the tapioca farms is designed and fabricated in a way such that it will not cause any damage to the crops. The weeder will only remove the unwanted weed crops in the farm. Apart from the weeding operation, the weeder can make the soil surface loose which will increase the porosity of the soil. Hence the water percolation will be more and the moisture content of the soil can also be maintained. Thus, the weeder will reduce the costs involved in the maintenance of the tapioca farm lands.

The conversion involve the preprocessing of rice straw which includes drying and its conversion to powder form. This paper proposes the microwave assisted drying process for rice straw. The single strand of rice straw is considered in the paper. The Multiphysics simulation is performed to understand the heat generation and heat-transfer rate with variation in the size of rice straw. The proposed process involves the cutting of rice straw to specific sizes. The rice straw size plays an important role in absorbing microwave energy. The heating pattern depends on the mode of transverse electric field interacting with specified size of rice straw. The different modes getting excited in the rice straw depends on its size. It is observed in this paper that the large size of rice straw help in achieving multiple modes in a single strand of rice straw.

hqsz7,"A novel approach for the determination of sorption equilibria and sorption enthalpy used for MOF aluminium fumarate with water","Adsorption chillers offer an environmentally friendly solution for the valorisation of waste or solar heat for cooling demands. A recent application is high efficiency data centre cooling, where heat from CPUs is used to drive the process, providing cooling for auxiliary loads. The metal organic framework aluminium fumarate with water is potentially a suitable material pair for this low temperature driven application. A targeted heat exchanger design is a prerequisite for competitiveness, requiring, amongst other things, a sound understanding of adsorption equilibria and adsorption enthalpy. A novel method is employed for their determination based on small isothermal and isochoric state changes, applied with an apparatus developed initially for volume swing frequency response measurement, to samples with a binder-based adsorbent coating. The adsorption enthalpy is calculated through the Clausius–Clapeyron equation from the obtained slopes of the isotherm and isobar, while the absolute uptake is determined volumetrically. The isotherm confirms the step-like form known for aluminium fumarate, with a temperature dependent inflection point at prel ≈ 0.25, 0.28 and 0.33 for 30 °C, 40 °C and 60 °C. The calculated differential enthalpy of adsorption is 2.90 ± 0.05 MJ/kg (52.2 ± 1.0 kJ/mol) on average, which is about 10–15% higher than expected by a simple Dubinin approximation.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ec40564f3e87e0055574b0e/,67,https://engrxiv.org/hqsz7/,10.31224/osf.io/hqsz7,10.3390/en13113003,2020-05-19T17:15:31.066439,2020-06-11T15:49:55.718196
t4wbq,"Inﬂuence of Shear Cutting Process Parameters on the Residual Stress State and the Fatigue Strength of Gears","Shear cutting is used for manufacturing various parts ranging from e.g. simple washers to complex gears. The latter are typically subjected to cyclic loading and fail foremost due to fatigue damages. Hereby, the parts lifetime is mainly determined by: the geometry, the applied load, the material, the hardness, the roughness and the residual stress state. While numerous research works deal with the inﬂuence of the process parameters on the hardness and the parts geometry, the inﬂuence of the process parameters on the residual stress state and on the resulting fatigue strength has not been investigated in detail, yet. In an earlier publication, suitable shear cutting techniques, which allow to achieve a high amount of clean-cut and a favorable residual stress state were compared. In this paper, the inﬂuence of the process parameters on the residual stress state and the resulting bending fatigue strength are addressed. To simulate the bending stress occurring in the tooth root, C-shaped specimens were manufactured by diﬀerent blanking techniques. The die-clearance and punch and die edge radii were varied with these blanking techniques. After measuring the cut-surface geometry, the hardness distribution and the surface roughness, the fatigue strength was determined in a pulsating test rig. By carrying out residual stress measurements using x-ray diﬀraction and simulating the material ﬂow behavior using the Finite-Element-Method, basic mechanisms, which are inﬂuencing the residual stress state and the resulting bending fatigue strength, were identiﬁed and will be presented and discussed in the paper.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ec391c5f3e87e0032579854/,62,https://engrxiv.org/t4wbq/,10.31224/osf.io/t4wbq,,2020-05-25T19:30:01.046479,2020-05-25T19:30:32.600033

u6skx,"Additive manufacturing of highly reconfigurable plasmonic circuits for terahertz communications","Terahertz communications is a booming field in rapid development. While in most of the existing terahertz communication systems, modulated THz carrier wave is transmitted via free-space communication channels, the THz waveguide-based integrated solutions can be of great utility both at the transmitter and receiver ends. Thus, at the transmitter end they can be used for steering, beam forming, and multiplexing of the THz signals. At the receiver end, terahertz waveguide-based solutions can be used as reliable interconnects (especially in the geometrically complex environments, ex. intra-vehicle communications), as well as for real-time analogue signal processing such as filtering and demultiplexing. More generally, waveguide-based THz optical circuits are indispensable for miniaturization and mass production of cost-effective THz communication systems. In this work, we present comprehensive numerical, fabrication and optical characterization studies of a new type of modular THz integrated circuits based on the micro-encapsulated two-wire plasmonic waveguides. Particular attention is payed to the design of optimized components such as waveguides, couplers and waveguide Bragg gratings to realize easy to handle, highly reconfigurable terahertz circuits capable of complex functionalities such as multiplexing and demultiplexing. The basic element of all the developed subcomponents is a low-loss low-dispersion two-wire waveguide suspended inside of a protective micro-sized enclosure (cage) using deeply subwavelength dielectric supports. The high resolution stereolithography 3D printing and wet chemistry metal deposition techniques are employed to fabricate such waveguides where the THz light is mainly confined in the air gap between the two wires. First, the straight waveguides are characterized using continuous-wave THz spectroscopy system with the measured transmission loss and group velocity dispersion (GVD) of 6 m-1 and -1.5 ps/THz·cm respectively at the carrier frequency of 140 GHz. Next, waveguide bends and a Y-coupler based on the two coalescing waveguide bends are studied. We find that due to the presence of a cage, the curved two-wire waveguides show smaller bending loss than the free-standing two-wire waveguides of similar geometry. Additionally, we find that relatively tight bends of ~5cm-radius can be well tolerated by adding less than ~10 m-1 propagation losses to the curved waveguide propagation loss. Next, we design and fabricate the two-wire waveguide Bragg gratings by hot stamping a periodic sequence of metal strips onto a paper sheet and inserting it into the air gap between the two-wire waveguides. The geometry of the grating featuring a Bragg frequency of 140 GHz is studied theoretically and numerically, and the optimal waveguide gratings are then realized experimentally. Such structures can have bandwidths as high as ~20 GHz. Finally, using thus developed modular components, a two channel THz Add-Drop Multiplexer (ADM) is demonstrated for the operation at 140 GHz carrier frequency and featuring a spectral width of 2.8 GHz. We believe that the reported modular platform based on the micro-encapsulated two-wire waveguides can have a strong impact on the field of integrated optical circuits for THz signal processing and potentially sensing due to ease of device fabrication (standard 3D printers and wet chemistry), modular design and high degree of reconfigurability, low-loss and low-dispersion of the underlying waveguides, as well as high potential for the real-time tunability of the optical circuits due to ease of access of the modal fields inside the controlled in-cage environment.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ec2a4b1f3e87e0017570eb0/,91,https://engrxiv.org/u6skx/,10.31224/osf.io/u6skx,,2020-05-18T17:10:43.503457,2020-05-18T17:31:03.173808

However their eventual impact in South Africa, a developing country with a low-capacity carbon-heavy grid, is questionable. This paper examines the potential impact of electrification of the vehicle fleet in South Africa, and explores the concept that large employers could take advantage of the country’s abundant sunshine and provide photovoltaic (PV) solar carports for employees to charge their vehicles while at work. We assess the extent to which this would reduce the potential burden on the national grid, and also consider the economic perspectives of the vehicle owners and the employers. Our assessment employs a mobility model and a battery model for the vehicles, and solar simulation with measured data for the PV generation. We show that without the provision of additional solar generation, charging four million vehicles from the grid would exceed the grid’s capacity. Further, the carbon footprint of an electric vehicle charged from the grid would be greater than that of a petrol-fuelled vehicle, negating any potential benefits of electrification. However, we demonstrate that photovoltaic charging at work renders electric vehicles more carbon-friendly than petrol equivalents, and has substantial financial benefits for the vehicle owner, the employer, and the grid.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ec1f9fe221cb10096130c08/,192,https://engrxiv.org/vp6jq/,10.31224/osf.io/vp6jq,10.1016/j.esd.2020.05.007,2020-05-18T13:54:09.713528,2020-06-30T14:42:16.790177

Moreover, this sector demands a detailed review of energy uses and other factors that are addressed as priority issues in most developed countries. In this framework, groundwater pumping energy requirements for agriculture irrigation emerge as a relevant topic to be improved in terms of power demand. Actually, this demand is currently supplied by diesel equipment solutions, with relevant drawbacks such as: (i) a large energy dependence on fossil fuels for the agricultural sector and (ii) a lack of participation in reducing

Similarly to some previous models, it is based on summation of fields scattered by discrete sub-resolution scatterers and enables accounting for axial and lateral inhomogeneity of the illuminating Gaussian beam. The main feature ensuring high computational efficiency of the described model is that instead of numerical integration of the scattered signal over the receiving aperture we apply analytical description of both the illuminating-beam focusing and collection of the scattered signals over the receiving aperture. Elimination of numerical integration over the receiving aperture has increased the computation speed by a factor of ~ 10^3. This is of key importance for practical feasibility of simulations of 3D OCT data volumes for large amounts (~ 10^5-10^7 ) of scatterers corresponding to realistic densities of cells in biological tissues.

6wy5c,"Impacts of Coronavirus COVID-19 on the Global Shipping and Maritime Industry in Indonesia and How to Overcome the Coronavirus Outbreak  Based on WHO and IMO recommendations","Since entering the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, the global share of Chinese container shipments grew up from 10% in 2003 to 14% in 2019. While the share of imports of dry bulk commodities to world volumes has jumped sharply from only 11 % to 34% in the same period. Based on the total dry bulk commodities, the portion of China in the global market is very dominant and become the major player in this industry. China imports 20% of chemicals, 18% gas, and 16% crude oil in 2019. It is understandable that the turmoil in China will have an upstream and downstream impact in the global production chain including Indonesia. The rapid spread of coronavirus has had a major impact on global shipping markets, with the slump in demand for goods from China having a ripple effect on everything from container ships to oil tankers. The freight rate for global container lines generally drops at a sharp rate of 10% -15%. A radical drop in demand for Chinese crude tankers from an average of 3.4 billion tonne miles per day in 2019 to almost zero. This was just the start of what was about to become a global crisis for all sectors including shipping. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the impacts of the Coronavirus COVID-19 on the maritime industry especially in Indonesia, and how to overcome the coronavirus outbreak based on World Health Organization (WHO) and International Maritime Organization (IMO) recommendations.

gn78a,"Cyber Security Threat Modeling in the Construction Industry: A Countermeasure Example During the Commissioning Process","The digitalization and automation of the construction sector, known as Construction 4.0, are transforming positively the way we plan, design, execute, and operate construction projects. However, they are also increasing the vulnerability of construction projects and making the architecture, engineering, construction, and facility management (AEC-FM) industry subject to cyberattacks. Although current cybersecurity practices are relevant, they cannot be directly adopted because of the unique challenges faced by the AEC-FM industry, such as complex supply chains, interoperability, and dynamic workforce from project to project. Current literature suggests that, though current standards and practices are relevant, industry-specific studies need to be conducted before they can be successfully integrated. To that extent, this study investigates the cybersecurity threat modeling for construction projects by developing a framework that identifies what might be compromised, how might it happen, why would someone intend to do it, what would be the impact, and what could be done to prevent it. Specifically, the objectives are to a) develop a preliminary threat model relevant to construction that can be used by construction stakeholders with minimal cybersecurity expertise, b) show the feasibility of the approach by using illustrative threat models for each of the life cycle phases of a construction project, and c) use the commissioning phase of a building as a case study to show a possible countermeasure for the cyber threats that could occur during the testing or certification process of a given system. This study addresses essential components to enable the full potential of (i.e., digitalization and automation of the construction industry) and define research areas needed to pave the roadmap for the future of the construction industry and successful development of Construction 4.0. The proposed framework will help analyze, examine, and address the safety and security of stakeholders and systems during crucial phases of a construction project (e.g., pre-construction, construction, and operation).",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eb38564877c5e00813a634b/,150,https://engrxiv.org/gn78a/,10.31224/osf.io/gn78a,,2020-05-07T13:39:53.775358,2020-05-07T14:15:01.114497

A burgeoning segment of the modern arsenal of medications pose a similar risk. Cytotoxic and genotoxic medications are commonly cited examples of what this author classifies as hazardous drugs.  However, due to the ambiguity or outright absence of textual warning labels on these medications, individuals who suffer incidental exposure in preparation, handling, administration and disposal of the drug may be compromising their health and safety. The risk posed by hazardous drugs is not limited to those within the healthcare community either, due to the large number of individuals who handle hazardous drugs during the process of manufacturing, transport, administration, and disposal. The author proposes a simple, clear label by which all individuals who come in contact with hazardous drugs – regardless of background – can readily distinguish between hazardous and non-hazardous drugs. The implementation of the labeling system proposed herein has the potential to increase awareness of handling risks for hazardous drugs, thereby improving health, safety, and the environment.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eb363f8a21995007b5d86ed/,46,https://engrxiv.org/tgfdy/,10.31224/osf.io/tgfdy,,2020-05-07T13:38:12.194056,2020-05-07T13:38:28.078217

and contributing to morbidity and mortality in haemodialysis patients. Non-invasive continuous blood
pressure monitoring is not part of routine practice but may aid detection and prevention of significant
falls in blood pressure during dialysis. Brachial blood pressure is currently recorded intermittently during
haemodialysis via a sphygmomanometer. Current methods of continuous non-invasive blood pressure
monitoring tend to restrict movement, can be sensitive to external disturbances and patient movement,
and can be uncomfortable for the wearer. Additionally, poor patient blood circulation can lead to unreliable measurements. In this feasibility study we performed an initial validation of a novel method
and associated technology to continuously estimate blood pressure using pressure sensors in the extracorporeal dialysis circuit, which does not require any direct contact with the person receiving dialysis
treatment.
The paper describes the development of the measurement system and subsequent in vivo patient feasibility study with concurrent measurement validation by Finapres Nova experimental physiological measurement device. We identify a mathematical function to describe the relationship between arterial line
pressure and brachial artery BP, which is confirmed in a patient study. The methodology presented requires no interfacing to proprietery dialysis machine systems, no sensors to be attached to the patient directly, and is robust to patient movement during treatment and also to the effects of the cyclical pressure
waveforms induced by the hemodialysis peristaltic blood pump. This represents a key enabling factor to
the development of a practical continuous blood pressure monitoring device for dialysis patients. This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

d9ypk,"A holistic evaluation of the impact of UK renewable strategy on emissions","Reduction in fossil fuels, contributing to greenhouse gases, and improvement of air quality from vehicle emissions is of growing concern worldwide. This has led to the introduction of several binding and non-binding agreements, such as the Renewable Energy Directive to increase the renewable content of fuel for transportation, the carbon dioxide emissions standards to limit the amount of carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles and the Euro Standards to limit the amount of emissions harmful to human health in the exhaust. However, the influence of the fuel composition on hazardous exhaust emissions is a complex, and often contradictory, relationship between factors such as the fuel properties, combustion characteristics and engine load. Therefore policy implemented to improve one aspect, such as a reduction in carbon dioxide, can have a detrimental effect on another such as increased NOx emissions.

This paper analyses, in a holistic manner, the impact on carbon dioxide and harmful emissions from transient compression ignition engines when increasing the renewable content of the fuel to meet the renewable energy targets. The analysis is based on a model developed from a rigorous Design of Experiment methodology used to determine the complex relationship between renewable fuel content and exhaust emissions (carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides). Unlike other studies, the results were collected from a transient engine cycle, the World Harmonised Light vehicle Test Procedure, rather than steady state conditions, thus the results are more applicable to the real world.

The results generally show that as the amount of ethanol is increased then the NOx and CO emissions decrease compared to current pump diesel. Increasing the biodiesel content generally increases the CO and CO2 emissions from the engine. For practical reasons a ternary blend is required to minimise the diesel engine emissions whilst meeting the UK’s future renewable content target. A blend of B2.4E10 was found to be the optimum compromise between renewable content and engine emissions. However, for this to be achieved the UK will have to invest in second and third generation ethanol.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eb17a5069d3e10168deaaa8/,77,https://engrxiv.org/d9ypk/,10.31224/osf.io/d9ypk,10.1016/j.fuel.2020.117586,2020-05-05T15:12:19.256789,2020-05-05T15:12:41.965516

from various lung disorders, associated with the production and secretion of excessive
quantities of mucus within the airways and help to loosen the mucous so that it tends
to be hacked from the lungs. Meanwhile, the mucous in the lungs becomes thick and
difficult to wash out from the air routes. When this mucous remain in the air routes, it
blocks airways and becomes hard to relax. The disease is likely to be conceivable if
the mucous remains permanently in the air routes. When one breathes out through this
device, it bounces the ball inside to it. This action produces signals around 15 Hz and
forward the vibration via the air ways. This amalgamation of enhanced intensity and
vibration aids the mucous in moving into the air ways where it remains. Some patients
can’t blow for a longer duration, therefore a feedback system is designed in such a
way that the pressure is measured using a pressure sensor. If the value goes below the
certain threshold limit the beep sound is heard and a light indication is provided so
that we can find whether the patient should blow effectively. The Blowing time (how
much time duration the patient is blowing) was measured and display in the LCD
screen. The forced expiratory flow volume (FEV1) and Peak Expiratory Flow Rate
(PEFR) was calculated that gives an idea about the status of the lungs. The Mann

directly from the sunlight by using electronic processes and there is no greenhouse
emission in photovoltaic cell as it does not require any other source of fuel like coal,

distribution, problem like overfitting and underfitting also exists. To overcome that,
the proposed work deals with capturing the hotspot as thermal image through an
infrared camera which is mainly used for temperature distribution. For identifying
hotspot, the features like shade, correlation, contrast, energy, entropy, homogeneity,
prominence, sparse are extracted using sparse reconstruction and GLCM algorithms.
The features are given to the classification algorithm named as Extreme Learning
Machine which gives the good generalization performance and improves accuracy
higher when compared to other algorithms. The overfitting and underfitting problem

fix fault sooner by managing the testing schedule by running such test cases earlier.
Faults associated with hazardous components can also be detected sooner. In riskbased testing, the probability of a fault becoming a reality is assessed, and the damage
that this fault can cause when leading to failure is considered. This study has

with practical approach to high level of security and shorter bit size of encryption.
Public key encryption is a reliable cryptographic method for mobile adhoc networks.
Still, some shortcomings of key management deter the reputation of its utilization in
the real-time environment. One major disadvantage in the crucial necessity of
elucidation is the key escrow problem. For secure group-based data transmission in
the distributed environment, a secret key has to be shared among the users for the
secured data transmission. For establishing efficient key distribution and
management, a novel dynamic group secret key management is introduced. In this
paper, we propose a signcryption based hyper elliptic curve cryptography framework
for key escrow. Here the model of scheme is to divide a large group into several
subgroups, each maintaining its subgroup secret keys to control the subgroup and
managing many subgroups using Key Escrow Based Hyper Elliptic Curve
Cryptography management algorithm. In the paper, a new methodology for
collaborative key management using signcryption is implemented. The environment
for mobile networks with the proposed algorithm named signcryption based Key

dxrq9,"AN INVESTIGATION ON THE SHRINKAGE CHARACTERISTICS OF HYBRID FIBER REINFORCED CONCRETE PRODUCED BY USING FIBERS OF DIFFERENT ASPECT RATIO","In the present paper, effects of shrinkage in fiber reinforced concrete are studied.
Here, in the current research work, an attempt is made to study the effects on
shrinkage of concrete when five different fiber materials are used for reinforcing plain
concrete. Three configurations of each reinforcing fiber material is studied. Fiber
aspect ratios of 40 and 100 and a combination of the fibers of the two aspect ratios in
equal proportion (hybrid) make up the three configurations for one individual fiber
material reinforcement. Shrinkage values are indicated in terms of total length of
crack and the total area of the crack. On-field measurement of crack dimensions at
periodic time intervals ranging from 0 minutes to 28 days after casting of concrete has
been undertaken to determine the accurate values of shrinkage cracks in the fifteen
scenarios i.e. five reinforcing fiber materials with three configurations each using
aspect ratio of fibers 40, 100 and the hybrid (40 +100) case. It is seen that,
irrespective of the material of fiber used for reinforcing concrete, hybridized concrete
consistently shows better results relative to single aspect ratio fiber reinforcement.
This research also aims to provide a bench mark for future research works on
shrinkage characteristics of hybridized fiber reinforced concrete",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eac2a0ce4f08102f9075660/,56,https://engrxiv.org/dxrq9/,10.31224/osf.io/dxrq9,10.34218/IJARET.11.3.2020.003,2020-05-01T14:06:43.822324,2020-05-04T15:03:45.184469

zdfm6,"Gas sensors based on dielectrophoresis of graphene, and graphene oxide, and reduced graphene oxide A Review","Dielectrophoresis (DEP) is a label-free, accurate, fast, and low-cost diagnostic technique that uses the principles of polarization and the motion of bioparticles in applied electric fields. DEP occurs when uncharged particles in the solution are subject to a spatially non-uniform alternating-current (AC) electric field, resulting in the motion of particles by creating a polarizability gradient between the particles and the suspending medium. The movement of particles in DEP is based on the difference in polarizability between the particles and the surrounding medium. If the particles move toward the electrode edge, the region of high electric field gradient, the response is called positive DEP (p-DEP). At the same time, if the particles move away from the electrode edge, the response is called negative DEP (n-DEP). This phenomenon provides a powerful and versatile tool for the non-destructive manipulation of nanoscale materials, allowing for the control of the resistance and the type of the assembly. This technique has been proven to be beneficial in various fields, including environmental research,  polymer research, sensors, biosensors, microfluidics, medicine, and diagnostics. This paper reviews the fundamentals of DEP and its specific application in the incorporation of graphene, graphene oxide(GO), and reduced graphene oxide(RGO), enabling the assembly of individual two-dimensional nanostructures at predefined locations in microdevices for gas sensor applications.

Currently, most of communications research in this spectral range is focused on wireless systems, while waveguide/fiber-based links have been less explored. Although free space communications have several advantages such as convenience in mobility for the end user, as well as easier multi-device interconnectivity in simple environments, the fiber-based communications provide superior performance in certain short-range communication applications such as multi-device connectivity in complex geometrical environments (ex. intra-vehicle connectivity), secure communications with low probability of eavesdropping, as well as secure signal delivery to hard-to-reach or highly protected environments. In this work, we present an in-depth experimental and numerical study of the short-range THz communications links that use subwavelength dielectric fibers for information transmission and define main challenges and tradeoffs in the link implementation. Particularly, we use air or foam-cladded polypropylene-core subwavelength dielectric THz fibers of various diameters (0.57-1.75 mm) to study link performance as a function of the link length of up to ~10 m, and data bitrates of up to 6 Gbps at the carrier frequency of 128 GHz (2.34 mm wavelength). We find that depending on the fiber diameter, the quality of the transmitted signal is mostly limited either by the modal propagation loss or by the fiber velocity dispersion (GVD). An error-free transmission over 10 meters is achieved for the bit rate of 4 Gbps using the fiber of smaller 0.57 mm diameter. Furthermore, since the fields of subwavelength fibers are weakly confined and extend deep into the air cladding, we study the modal field extent outside of the fiber core, as well as fiber bending loss. Finally, the power budget of the rod-in-air subwavelength THz fiber-based links is compared to that of free space communication links and we demonstrate that fiber links offer an excellent solution for various short-range applications.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ea6fcbae4f081011e0750fa/,126,https://engrxiv.org/bjpdm/,10.31224/osf.io/bjpdm,,2020-04-27T16:11:02.197301,2020-05-04T15:01:02.571086

embedded in concrete. Corrosion of steel reinforcing bars or embedded steel in concrete structural
components is a major concern for structures such as bridges and parking garages. Moisture and
chloride ingress through the cracks is the primary reason for corrosion of such concrete structures. The
chloride and moisture levels significantly affect the electrical conductivity of concrete. A low cost sensor
for measuring concrete resistivity (or conductivity) was developed by researchers at West Virginia
University. This sensor is very durable and can be embedded in concrete members (beams, columns,

can be used to evaluate the potential for corrosion of embedded steel. This paper presents laboratory
and field results obtained using the sensor to demonstrate its usefulness. The paper also highlights the
simplicity and ease of use of this sensor. In addition, the paper also discusses the use of a

Pipeline locating operations are carried out during construction, rehabilitation, or farming activities in order to avoid digging into the buried pipeline; or to locate the pipe for maintenance work. Several techniques exist for locating buried pipelines, including Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and tracer wires. GPR is less effective in locating non-metallic pipes or pipes buried in very wet and electrically conductive soils, while the tracer wire technique can only be used if the wires are buried with the pipe. A method of locating buried pipelines transporting hot fluids using Infrared Thermography (IRT) is presented in this paper. Additionally, IR cameras come in portable and compact form factors, which make it possible for it to be mounted on UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) or to be integrated into UAV inspection systems. A 7.6 cm (3 inch) diameter Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) composite pipe buried at 35.6 cm (14 inch) depth and transporting hot water was easily detected in the laboratory using IRT. A 15.2 cm (6 inch) diameter pipe buried at 91.4 cm (3 ft) depth and transporting steam in the field environment was also detected all year round in different weather conditions with IRT.

mntvy,"Large-scale introduction of forest-based biorefineries: actor perspectives and the impacts of a dynamic biomass market","Large-scale implementation of forest-based biofuel production will have an impact on biomass prices, something which in turn will affect biofuel production costs. The profitability of emerging biofuel production technologies is usually assessed using techno-economic or market approaches. While techno-economic approaches have a detailed description of technologies within plant-level or supply chain system boundaries, they build on exogenously given static biomass prices. Conversely, market approaches have a consistent description of the economic system including market interactions for prices within local or national boundaries, but they generally lack technological depth. This paper combines these two approaches using an iterative framework for a case study optimising the production cost of liquefied biomethane (LBG) using different configurations of sawmill-integrated biomass gasification. 
Cost estimates are developed using system boundaries reflecting the plant owner and policymaker perspectives, respectively. The results show that different plant configurations are favoured depending on the choice between minimising the biofuel production cost for the plant-owner or for the policymaker. Market dynamics simulated by the iterative procedure show that a direct policy support of 36-56 EUR/MWh would be needed to sustain large-scale LBG production, which is 12-31% higher than the necessary policy support estimated based on static biomass prices.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ea2cf1b41327c0037c7f928/,57,https://engrxiv.org/mntvy/,10.31224/osf.io/mntvy,,2020-04-24T13:58:38.991787,2020-04-24T13:59:17.397342

The deletion positions are unknown to both sender and receiver, and the number of bits received before channel closure is unknown to both sender and receiver. The number of received bits is in the range 1-100. This paper argues that, for such a channel, an encoding method that enables the calculation of probability masses for all possible packets is preferred to one which attempts perfect reconstruction of the transmitted packet. It then presents and analyzes such an encoding method. The presented method encodes information on the probability of receiving a 1 vs. a 0, rather than in the 1's and 0's themselves. The receiver decodes the information using Bayesian inference. Rather than transmitting the packet of interest, the encoding method transmits information about the packet of interest in order to guarantee information transfer for any nonzero number of bits received.

Since falls represent one of the first causes of death in such people, numerous clinical tests have been created and validated over the past thirty years to ascertain the risk of falls. More recently, the developments of low-cost motion capture sensors have facilitated observations of gait differences between fallers and non-fallers. The aim of this study is twofold. First to design a method combining clinical tests and motion capture sensors in order to optimize the prediction of the risk of fall. Second to assess the ability of an artificial intelligence to predict risk of fall from sensor raw data only. Seventy-three nursing home residents over the age of 65 underwent the Timed Up and Go (TUG) and a 6 minutes walking tests equipped with a home-designed wearable Inertial Measurement Unit during two sets of measurements at 6 months interval. Observed falls during that interval enabled us to divide residents into two categories: fallers and non-fallers.

3v6be,"Design for additive manufacturing - effects of part orientation, printer selection, and infill density on mechanical properties and production cost","This original work investigates the influence of infill design, printer selection, and part orientation on the mechanical properties and production cost of parts fabricated using material extrusion additive manufacturing systems. Flexural test specimens are fabricated in both production-grade (Fortus 250mc) and entry-level (MakerBot Replicator 2X) material extrusion systems with varying infill densities (1 mm to 10 mm spacing between rasters). In addition, solid infill specimens are printed in three orientations to establish baseline mechanical stiffness and strength. Finite element simulations and a simplified analytical model based on Euler-Bernoulli beam theory are developed. Results show reasonable agreement between analytical, simulation, and experimental results; 10-20% and 10-40% deviation for production-grade and entry-level specimens specimens, respectively. There is a 40% reduction in stiffness and strength between the solid XY specimen and 1 mm infill specimen. As infill density is further decreased, stiffness and strength asymptotically reduces by 60-70% when compared to solid specimens. This effect is more pronounced in specimens fabricated using entry-level printers, which indicates that printer selection plays a role in printing highly sparse parts. Cost analysis suggests that up to 40% savings can be achieved with highly sparse structures. However, for structural parts, it is recommended that parts be printed with solid infill and with the loading direction aligned in the XY plane to achieve high stiffness, high strength, and reasonable cost. Findings from this study show that there is minimal cost savings but high reduction in mechanical stiffness and strength when sparse infills are used in both production-grade and entry-level printers. Hence, it is recommended that solid infill should be used in all regions of parts that carry significant mechanical stress and sparse infill be used solely to support internal geometries and overhangs.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e9dc69fd6973506b4bdade3/,173,https://engrxiv.org/3v6be/,10.31224/osf.io/3v6be,,2020-04-20T21:09:06.403672,2020-04-21T05:02:26.979732

The best efficiency performance of system is achieved by the 15 minutes drain time and air mass flux of 0.011 kgm^(-2) s^(-1), while the best power generation of the system will be obtained by the 30 minutes drain time and air mass flux of 0.011 kgm^(-2) s^(-1).",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e9b35cfd697350652bdb268/,86,https://engrxiv.org/79wmg/,10.31224/osf.io/79wmg,,2020-04-18T18:20:53.091538,2020-04-19T05:03:29.544844
9cvp5,"Electrochemical Modeling and Techno -Economic Analysis of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell for Residential Applications","In this paper, an electrochemical model was developed to investigate the performance analysis of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC). The curves of voltage, power, efficiency, and the generated heat of cell have been analyzed to accomplish a set of optimal operating conditions. Further, a sensitivity analysis of major parameters that have a remarkable impact on the economy of the SOFC and its residential applications has been conducted. The results illustrate that the current density and cell performance temperature have vital effects on the system efficiency, output power and heat generation of cell of the SOFC. The best system efficiency is approached up to 53.34 % while implementing combined heat and power generation might be further improved up to 86 %. The economic evaluation results indicate that parameters such as overall efficiency, natural gas price and additional produced electricity that has prone to be sold to the national power grid, have a significant impact on the SOFC economy. The results indicate the strong reduction in the purchasing cost of the SOFC, i.e. not more than $2500, and improving the electrical efficiency of SOFC, i.e. not less than 42 %, can be the breakeven points of investment on such systems in residential applications. Also, it is found that the target of this SOFC cogeneration system for residential applications in Iran is relying on considerable technological enhancement of the SOFC, as well as life cycle improvement; improvement in governmental policies; and profound development in infrastructures to mitigate legal constraints.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e9b25b8d69735063dbda254/,79,https://engrxiv.org/9cvp5/,10.31224/osf.io/9cvp5,,2020-04-18T16:54:52.280662,2020-04-19T05:03:27.841603
z3p7q,"BREED - A Problem Solving Bionic Design Methodology","Bionic designs which have evolved from time-tested strategies of nature have been
a source of inspiration for designers to solve problems. The beauty of nature’s form
is derived from effective evolution and robustness of its function. Current bionic
design methods are analogical and hence are discordant to the design engineering
workflow. In this paper, a methodology is proposed which suggests suitable bionic
structures to a given design space. The methodology consists of the following stages
which are Bionic representation, Relation, Emulation, Engineering specifications,
Design verification and optimisation (BREED) and finally realization. This
methodology aims to function as a systematic problem-solving approach to retrieve
structural inspirations from nature and mimic its form. The methodology also
integrates biological inputs to the context of an engineering design problem.
Inspiration and validation phases of the bionic structure are represented as a V-
model. The designer can leverage this framework to come up with novel bionic
design concepts. A structural dome is used as a case study to demonstrate the
procedure of BREED methodology. Biological forms for the dome are obtained
using a spectral matching technique. The bionic design is validated after applying
relevant boundary conditions and by using proven engineering methods.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e9a8c3043016605f3a082ca/,88,https://engrxiv.org/z3p7q/,10.31224/osf.io/z3p7q,,2020-04-18T14:35:44.262711,2020-07-11T06:58:37.068048

Such quick detection measures would allow the timely mitigation of the dreadful disease which has claimed close to 100,000 lives worldwide. In this article, a very fast and cheap way to detect the presence of SARS-CoV in the biopsied tissue has been proposed. The current method discussed here would drastically reduce the time of detection of an infected person to less than ~ 6 hours in addition to the economic benefit of using paper-based isoelectric focusing. The infecting coronavirus that causes severe respiratory distress contains four major types of structural proteins: spike (S) proteins, membrane (M) proteins, envelope (E) proteins &amp; nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Peculiar isoelectric points of these four structural proteins have been proposed to detect the SARS-CoV infection.

Thin shells are a common feature in many designs, providing good strength-to-weight ratios for many applications, particularly in the aerospace and structural design domains. The use of AM processes to produce thin structures could both expand the use of AM and improve the application space for thin structures in design, but this problem has not yet been widely explored for buckling cases. The brief exploratory study presented in this paper examined the characteristics and critical buckling load of thin-walled ABS and PLA cylinders under static axial and angled radial loading. A designed 2(4-1) factorial experiment was used to explore the buckling behavior, examining the impact of wall thickness, material, and two kinds of internal reinforcement (soft infill and polyurethane foam). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) (including model adequacy testing and proof of Fisher Assumption validity) was completed on data from two replications (32 total tests), providing useful information on the significance of the factors and their interactions. The data is provided in full, along with a discussion of the experimental design and testing method, the results, and the importance of this problem in further research efforts. The results of the tests showed a dramatic variance in the performance based on the characteristics of the cylinders. The data collected can be used to drive future work toward the modeling and design of hard polymer AM thin structures, as well as developing efficient and low-cost methods for testing and exploring these structures for practical design problems.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e961babd697350455bda16e/,89,https://engrxiv.org/f7h9j/,10.31224/osf.io/f7h9j,,2020-04-14T21:34:29.359285,2020-04-15T05:02:02.619151

The inner-to-outer radius ratio is 0.5. The Reynolds number based on bulk velocity and hydraulic diameter is 8900, while the Prandtl number is set to a value of 0.026. A uniform and equal heat flux is applied on both walls. LES has been chosen to provide sufficiently accurate results for validating Reynolds-Averaged turbulence models. Moreover, being the thermal sublayer thickness of liquid metals much larger than the viscous hydrodynamic one, liquid metals present a separation between the turbulent thermal and hydrodynamic scales. Thus, with the same grid resolution it is possible to perform a LES for the flow field and a “thermal“ Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) for the temperature field. Comparison of the forced convection results with available DNS simulations shows satisfying agreement. Results for mixed convection are analyzed and the differences with respect to forced convection at the same Reynolds number are thoroughly discussed.

The experiment is a vertical Rijke tube containing an electric heater. The heater drives a base flow via natural convection, and thermoacoustic oscillations via velocity-driven heat release fluctuations. The decay rates and frequencies of these oscillations are measured every few seconds by acoustically forcing the system via a loudspeaker placed at the bottom of the tube. More than 320,000 temperature measurements are used to compute state and parameters of the base flow model using the Ensemble Kalman Filter. A wave-based network model is then used to describe the acoustics inside the tube. We balance momentum and energy at the boundary between two adjacent elements, and model the viscous and thermal dissipation mechanisms in the boundary layer and at the  heater and thermocouple locations. Finally, we tune the parameters of two different thermoacoustic models on an experimental dataset that comprises more than 40,000 experiments. This study shows that, with thorough Bayesian inference, a qualitative model can become quantitatively accurate, without overfitting, as long as it contains the most influencial physical phenomena.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e9368e7f13535036dd55f17/,104,https://engrxiv.org/8bmaz/,10.31224/osf.io/8bmaz,,2020-04-12T20:01:41.302482,2020-04-13T00:15:00.764847

This approach involves a layer-wise deposition of concrete. A layer of printed concrete needs to be ``strong"" enough to sustain the weight of layers to be printed above. These layers may not bond well with each other, however. Self-compacting concrete (SCC) may lead to a better bonding, but it may not have sufficient strength. This paper presents a method to print SCC through controlled heating. Properties of printed concrete in fresh and hardened states are studied. Heating leads to a sharp rise in the strength of freshly-printed concrete layers, but a long duration of heating may lead to a reduction in strength of printed concrete after hardening particularly if water-to-cement ratio is small or if loads are applied parallel to the printed layers.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e92e6ac4301660328a0c24f/,126,https://engrxiv.org/sk6nt/,10.31224/osf.io/sk6nt,,2020-04-12T12:32:19.113340,2020-04-12T14:26:02.466394

kpv3r,"Subordinate Oscillator Arrays: Physical Design and Effects of Error","Prior work demonstrates that an attached subordinate oscillator array (SOA) can attenuate vibration of a host structure over a frequency range of interest.   A judicious choice of the distribution of masses and stiffnesses of the attached oscillators can result in a relatively flat frequency response of for the host structure over a desired band.  This response modification can be a significant improvement over classical dynamic vibration absorbers (DVA) that attenuate a structure's response at one target frequency while increasing the frequency response amplitude at nearby side frequencies. Performance of the SOA can be highly sensitive to the uncertainty or disorder in the mechanical properties of the system.  This paper introduces a novel design strategy that can make use of either 3D-printing or piezoelectric SOAs (PSOAs). These strategies have the potential to address and ameliorate such sensitivity to error.  It is important to note that the design strategy is simple and effective in that it can be carried out without computational optimization techniques by choosing simple or well-known distributions of properties.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e923258f135350334d5348f/,79,https://engrxiv.org/kpv3r/,10.31224/osf.io/kpv3r,,2020-04-13T16:09:11.050802,2020-04-14T05:04:03.246921
qb4up,"Expanding the Teaching of Single Frequency Vibration Absorption to Broadband Attenuation using Subordinate Oscillator Arrays via Fettuccine Pasta","Dynamic vibration absorbers (DVAs) and tuned mass-dampers (TVAs) have wide-spread applications in the aerospace industry, the automotive sector, and in civil engineering structures. There are numerous designs of active and passive vibration attenuators or absorbers that isolate structural vibrations at or around the desired frequency. All these design approaches are fundamentally different ways to modify and tune the placement of the resonant frequencies of the host structure. The current work presents a novel method to passively attenuate vibration over a broad frequency bandwidth in the presence of uncertainty. An array of linear oscillators, also referred to as subordinate oscillator arrays (SOAs), are attached to a two-degrees-of-freedom structure to produce an attenuated broadband frequency response around a target frequency. SOAs can also be interpreted as an array of DVAs and in some categories, they can be considered as an approach to meta-structures. 

Another objective of the current work is to develop a hands-on approach to extend classroom teaching of vibration-isolation using SOAs made out of fettuccine strands and modeling clay. The frequencies of the oscillators in the array are tuned by varying the length of each strand and the mass of the modeling clay attached to its tip. Uncertainty in dynamic properties of such oscillators often results in mistuned SOAs with non-uniform frequency response function. Therefore, designing and testing fettuccine-based SOAs allows students to handle cases when structural uncertainties arise in engineering systems. Additionally, some of the work in the field of meta-structures can be modeled and represented by SOAs and this will provide a straight forward way to teach students some of these contemporary concepts.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e90ee25f1353502e2d54914/,90,https://engrxiv.org/qb4up/,10.31224/osf.io/qb4up,,2020-04-11T01:32:54.333725,2020-04-11T01:33:21.994308

However, vessel routing and scheduling is a challenging exercise in liner shipping because of uncertainties that may affect the planned operations. Delays caused by uncertainties, such as weather, natural hazards, labor strikes, and others, increase the complexity of liner shipping, related to schedule adherence and reliability of service. In the event of a delay, liner shipping companies take decisions to recover the schedule, aiming to deliver cargoes in a timely manner. Vessel operators may decide to increase the sailing speed of the ship, which will further increase bunker fuel consumption and the total operational cost of liner shipping operations. The vessel schedule recovery problem becomes even more difficult if the delay is large. The contributions of this dissertation to the state-of-the-art are as follows: 1) a set of operational-level vessel schedule recovery models in liner shipping; 2) the vessel schedule recovery models for the liner shipping routes that pass through Emission Control Areas; 3) consideration of multiple vessel schedule recovery alternatives (e.g., port skipping with and without cargo diversion, speed adjustment, handling rate adjustment); 4) application of the appropriate solution approaches for solving the vessel schedule recovery problem; 5) identification of the key factors that may influence vessel schedule recovery; and 6) presentation of the managerial insights and benefits of the developed vessel schedule recovery optimization models.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e8f5d2df13535025ad540e0/,102,https://engrxiv.org/k47sq/,10.31224/osf.io/k47sq,10.13140/RG.2.2.32561.94565,2020-04-09T17:56:55.052629,2020-04-09T17:57:31.774702

r9af2,"Synthesis of Manganese Oxide Nanoparticles in Premixed Flames","Synthesis of manganese oxide nanoparticles was carried out in premixed stagnation flames. The deposition surface was stationary to enable rigorous comparison to flame structure computations using pseudo one-dimensional and full two-dimensional calculations. The pseudo one-dimensional assumption taken by OPPDIF to calculate the flame structure performs reasonably well for the narrow aspect ratio stagnation flow currently studied. Agreement between the measured flame position and both computational methods was within 0.25 cm. The variation in manganese oxidation state in the products observed here is shown to be caused by competing oxidation and particle nucleation processes. Complimentary experimental and modeling studies of flame synthesis were carried out under well-defined boundary conditions to examine this competition. Manganese oxide products having II, II,III, III and IV valence were observed depending on the flame conditions. Unlike iron oxide and titanium oxide systems, complete oxidation to MnO2 is only observed for the most oxidizing growth conditions.

The travel time which is currently reported on several highways is estimated by employing naïve methods and using limited sources of data. This results in unreliable and inaccurate travel time prediction and could impose delay on travelers. Therefore, the main objective of this study is short-term prediction of travel time for highways using multiple data sources including loop detectors, probe vehicles, weather condition, network, accidents, road works, and special events in order to consider the effect of different factors on travel time. To this end, two machine learning methods, K-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest, are employed. After applying data cleaning process on datasets and combining them, the models are trained to predict and compare short-term harmonic average speed as a representative of travel time for 5-minute prediction horizons in one hour ahead. The travel time is calculated as the ratio of the length of each link and the harmonic average speed for all reporting vehicles. Hence, a model is trained for each technique to predict travel time 5 minutes ahead, 10 minutes ahead, and all the way down to 60 minutes ahead. The results confirm satisfying performance of both models in short-term travel time prediction with slightly outperformance of Random Forest model.

2ygxq,"A Concept for Capturing and Docking Spacecraft with Flux-Pinned Interfaces","Flux-pinned interfaces for spacecraft leverage the physics of magnetic flux pinning to govern the dynamics between
close-proximity spacecraft. The behavior of this interface enables a magnet to be held at a distance in up to six degrees of freedom relative to a type-II superconductor without contact or active control systems. This behavior is the result of a magnetic potential well with an equilibrium set by designer of the interface. When applied to a conceptual sample capture scenario, this approach offers several unique advantages over traditional mechanical capture systems, including robustness to control failures and the ability to preferentially orient the capture target without mechanical keying features. However, as a passive system, it is important to characterize the depth and shape of the potential well in order to bound the acceptable relative motion between a notional spacecraft and a notional sample cache to ensure a successful capture. This paper presents the results of a series of air bearing experiments designed to determine these bounds. Extrapolating from the ground testing environment, it was determined that the FPI is expected to work at a range of 50 cm in orbit around Mars, and operates best in a path angle of 0 degrees. It can tolerate a total relative translational velocity of up to 4.7 cm/sec or a total angular rate of 24 deg/sec between a spacecraft and a sample cache.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e8b72bbd6973500b7bdcaf1/,85,https://engrxiv.org/2ygxq/,10.31224/osf.io/2ygxq,,2020-04-06T18:27:21.506307,2020-04-06T18:27:46.266387
rvcs3,"A Personal Respirator Specification for Health-care Workers Treating COVID-19 (PeRSo)","The SARS-CoV-2 virus infection is a rapidly spreading global pandemic. Recent media coverage has highlighted the importance of protecting health-care workers together with issues surrounding availability and suitability of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Around 20% of healthcare workers treating COVID19 cases in Italy have become infected which leads to staff absence at a critical point during the pandemic, and unfortunately in some cases mortality.
PPE plays a major role in control programs. Standard PPE such as N95/FFP3 facemasks have limitations such as an ineffective seal during talking or after prolonged use, face shapes which cannot be adequately fitted, and logistical issues ensuring availability of the correct mask for each person. Furthermore, global stock is low, and issues around diagnostic testing specificity and turnaround time may lead to infectious patients receiving care from health care staff who are not wearing appropriate PPE. 
To address acute shortcomings in PPE availability, we have developed a simple pressurised air purified respirator unit, incorporating a combination of inexpensive and widely available components parts. The prototype was developed to minimise the number and complexity of manufacturing steps with the intention that derivative versions could be developed in many different parts of the world, including low resource settings with minor modification, where transmission could be rapid amongst high population densities.
The “Personal Respirator – Southampton” (PeRSo) delivers HEPA filtered air from a battery powered fan-filter assembly through a lightweight hood/face mask that can be comfortably worn for several hours. Initial user feedback provided by doctors and nurses shows the PeRSo prototype was preferred to standard N95/FFP3 masks, being more comfortable, reducing time lost placing and removing PPE between patients, and allowing better communication. Preliminary tests indicate that the device removes microbes and passes the “fit tests” widely used to evaluate face masks. Full verification of the safety and the duration of effectiveness and durability of the device is required, as part of translation into use. Rapid upscale of production is required to protect healthcare workers from infection while the global situation accelerates, so that they can look after patients during the peak of the pandemic.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e8b5fb5d6973500cfbdb15c/,1741,https://engrxiv.org/rvcs3/,10.31224/osf.io/rvcs3,,2020-04-06T18:15:04.574041,2020-05-20T18:09:35.785733
27qs6,"Incorporation of titanate nanosheets to enhance mechanical properties of water-soluble polyamic acid","Pyromeliticdianhydride (PMDA) and 4’,4’-oxydianiline (ODA) were used as
monomers of polyimide. To synthesise a water soluble polyimide precursor (polyamic acid
salt), triethylamine (TEA) was added to polyamic acid with a TEA/COOH mole ratio of 1:1.
Titanate nanosheets were synthesised by solid-state reaction, ion-exchanged with acid, and
exfoliated by TEA. Exfoliated titanate nanosheets were mixed with water soluble polyamic
acid salt as reinforcing filler. Drop casting was deployed to synthesise polyamic acid/titanate
nanosheet nanocomposite films. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to study the morphology and dispersion of
nanosheets in the colloidal dispersion and the solid film composite. Modulus and hardness of
nanocomposites was provided by nanoindentation. Hardness increased by 90% with addition of

zn3wf,"Automatic Incremental Learning of Terrain Transitions in a Powered Below Knee Prosthesis","Objective: This paper describes the development
and preliminary offline validation of an algorithm facilitating
automatic, self-contained learning of ground terrain transitions
in a lower limb prosthesis. This method allows for continuous,
in-field convergence on an optimal terrain prediction accuracy
for a given walking condition, and is thus not limited by
the specific conditions and limited sample size of an in-lab
training scheme. Methods: We asked one subject with a below-knee
amputation to traverse level ground, stairs, and ramps
using a high-range-of-motion powered prosthesis while internal
sensor data were remotely logged. We then used these data
to develop a dynamic classification algorithm which predicts
the terrain of each stride and then continuously updates the
predictor using both data from the previous stride and an
accurate terrain back-estimation algorithm. Results: Across 100
simulations randomizing stride order, our method attained a
mean next-stride prediction accuracy of ? 96%. This value
was first reached after ? 200 strides, or about ? 5 minutes
of walking. Conclusion and significance: These results demonstrate
a method for automatically learning the gait patterns
preceding terrain transitions in a prosthesis without relying
on any external devices. By virtue of its dynamic learning
scheme, application of this method in real-time would allow for
continuous, in-field optimization of prediction accuracy across a
variety of walking variables including physiological conditions,
variable terrain geometries, control methodologies, and users.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e876feed0e35402bbb45b8a/,140,https://engrxiv.org/zn3wf/,10.31224/osf.io/zn3wf,,2020-04-04T21:40:22.482673,2020-04-04T21:40:41.546116
nt5e2,"Inhibition of Polyimide Photodegradation by Incorporation of Titanate Nanotubes into a Composite","The effect of UV light exposure on the properties of hexafluoroisopropylidene-diphthalic anhydride–oxydianiline (6FDA–ODA) polyimide (PI) and polyimide–titanate nanotube (TiNT/PI) composites has been studied using Raman spectroscopy, optical microscopy, nanoidentation and TEM. The degree of polymer photodegradation was estimated by measuring the change in affinity to a positively charged dye (methylene blue, MB). The mechanism of photoassisted transformations in polyimides usually involves scission of polymer chains accompanied by appearance of active radicals, which undergo further rapid transformations to more stable phenol, amine, and carboxylic functional groups. The accumulation of these groups can increase the degree of adsorption of charged dyes in the photodegraded polymer. It was found that neat PI showed a significantly increased capacity to adsorb MB after irradiation with UV, reaching a plateau after 1 h. In contrast, TiNT/PI composite demonstrated a much slower rise in concentration of adsorbed MB even after 4 h of UV exposure. Raman spectra indicated cleavage of C=O and C–F bonds in PI while only the C–F bond was damaged in TiNT/PI. Shorter cracks (≈ 40 µm long) appeared in TiNT/PI composites whereas macro cracks (&gt; 100 µm) were visible in neat PI after 3 h of UV exposure. Brittleness was studied by comparing plasticity index which varied from 0 to 1 (0 corresponding to the most brittle material and 1 the most ductile one). Plasticity index reduced by 51% and 2% for PI and TiNT/PI, respectively after 3 h UV irradiation, indicating that TiNT can protect underlying PI from further damage. The hardness of neat PI decreased whereas, for TiNT/PI, it increased under UV, suggesting crosslinking of broken polymer chains with nanotubes.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e871f661ab243027de050e6/,79,https://engrxiv.org/nt5e2/,10.31224/osf.io/nt5e2,10.1007/s10924-019-01443-w,2020-04-03T14:08:28.915718,2020-04-03T14:08:48.131071

Actual stone degradation in situ is estimated based on various laboratory tests which allow researchers to correlate the number of artificial ageing cycles of stone specimens with ultrasonic wave velocity measured on these specimens. Paper presents the results obtained for granite, marble, limestone, travertine and sandstone which undergone various cyclic ageing tests including freezing and thawing, high temperature and salt crystallisation. Analysis of the obtained results shows that independent of the stone type tested and independent of the ageing test applied a rate of change of the stone elastic properties is described by an ordinary differential equation which solution is an exponential law analogues to the Newton’s law of cooling.

Although flux-pinning physics has been studied from a materials-science perspective and at the systems level, the sensitivities and implications of system-level designs on the dynamics need to be better understood, especially in interfaces with multiple magnets and superconductors. These interfaces have highly nonlinear, coupled dynamics that are influenced by physical parameters including strength of magnetic field sources, field-cooled position, and superconductor geometry. Kordyuk’s frozen image model successfully approximates the characteristics of flux pinning dynamics but could provide more precise state prediction with the addition of these physical parameter refinements. This paper addresses that gap by offering parametric terms to improve the dynamics model, which may better simulate the behavior of a multiple-magnet-multiple-superconductor interface.

The contactless, compliant nature of flux pinning offers many benefits for close-proximity robotic maneuvers, such as rendezvous, docking, and actuation. This paper derives the six degree-of-freedom linear dynamics about an equilibrium for any magnet/superconductor configuration. Linearized dynamics are well suited to predicting close-proximity maneuvers, provide insights into the character of the dynamic system, and are essential for linear control synthesis. The equilibria and stability of a flux-pinned interface are found using Villani's equations for magnetic dipoles. Kordyuk's frozen-image model provides the nonlinear flux-pinning response to these magnetic forces and torques, all of which are then linearized.

zu3me,"Ion mobility and partition determine the counter-ion selectivity of ion exchange membranes","Ion (perm)selectivity and conductivity are the two most essential properties of an ion exchange membrane, yet no quantitative relation between them has been suggested. In this work, the selectivity between two different counter-ions is correlated to the membrane conductivity. We show that the counter-ion selectivity measured by conventional electrodialysis (ED) can be expressed by the product of two parameters: (a) the mobility ratio between these two different counter-ions in the membrane and (b) their partition coefficient between the solution and the membrane. This is reminiscent of the classical solution-diffusion model. Via the counter-ion mobility in the membrane, the selectivity could be simply expressed with the membrane conductivity and dimensional swelling degree at pure counter-ion forms and at mixed counter-ion form when the membrane has been equilibrated with 1:1 equivalence ratio of the two counter-ions in the solution. This correlation is validated experimentally for the ion selectivity of K+/Na+ in two commercial hydrocarbon-based cation exchange membranes (CEMs). For K+/Na+ in a commercial perfluorosulfonic CEM, and for Mg2+/Na+ in all the three types of CEMs, the correlation could predict the counter-ion partition very well; but there is an underestimation of the K+/Na+ and Mg2+/Na+ mobility ratios afforded by this correlation, which might be due to simplification of the cation activity coefficients in CEMs. This work offers a convenient method to decouple experimentally the effect of partition and mobility in controlling the membrane selectivity, and also proposes a new perspective to study the selectivity as well as conductivity of ion exchange membranes.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e8458028140b40184424695/,121,https://engrxiv.org/zu3me/,10.31224/osf.io/zu3me,10.1016/j.memsci.2019.117645,2020-04-01T13:33:41.912268,2020-04-01T13:34:02.538181

However, modern membrane process development experiences a disconnect in this domain: the synthesis of the membrane and the design of the process are decoupled. We propose an optimization strategy to simultaneously design the performance of layer-by-layer nanofiltration membrane modules and the separation process. This approach achieves overall optimal performance by extending the search space and thus exploiting synergies. Better separation performances at a lower cost as compared to conventional optimization strategies can be achieved. The key feature of this optimization framework is the integration of artificial neural networks. This machine-learning technique describes membrane performance as a function of its synthesis protocol. We optimize the design problem rigorously by a deterministic global nonlinear optimization method. Thus, this framework yields membrane synthesis protocols and membrane processes that are optimally tailored to the desired separation task. In a showcase, the simultaneous membrane synthesis and process optimization design achieve immediately favorable results with lower impurities at comparable costs. The process investment and operation costs are compared to a state of the art commercially available membrane for nanofiltration.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e8454961ab2430195e02684/,119,https://engrxiv.org/weph5/,10.31224/osf.io/weph5,10.1016/j.memsci.2020.117860,2020-04-01T13:32:46.272332,2020-04-01T13:33:01.731208
h3t7r,"Interlocking Spikes for Extreme Mobility","The interlock drive system generates traction by penetrating articulated spikes into the ground and by using the natural strength of the ground for traction. A fundamental problem of traction by interlocking spikes is how to penetrate the ground such that the spike will withstand the draft force. The theory of critical depth suggests that a high rake angle reduces soil fragmentation, while vehicle stability and demand for a high pull/weight ratio require a low thrust angle. To satisfy both requirements, we connect an interlocking spike with a high rake angle via a lever arm to a hinge close to the ground for a low thrust angle. The resulting friction of the spike with the soil increases the vertical penetration force during penetration. Experimental data shows that such a spike penetrates soil of a much higher penetration resistance than predicted from an analysis of the forces involved, possibly because the spike follows the path of least resistance. To better understand and improve the potential of interlocking spikes for mobility in extreme terrain, we need a comprehensive experimental analysis. Accepted Paper in Proc.

Social shaping of technology (SST) of specific household electric appliances provides a critical lens of understanding the involved socio-technical drivers behind these constraints. This study employs an SST lens to investigate appliance uptake drivers in Rwanda using the EICV5 micro dataset, such that these drivers can aid in policy design of a socially inclusive renewable energy transition. The methodology includes a systemic and epistemological review of current literature on the drivers of appliance uptake in the Global South. These drivers were then analysed using binary logistic regression on 14,580 households. Results show that appliance uptake is highly gendered in Rwanda and the type of appliance determines its diffusion across the welfare categories, commonly referred as to Ubudehe categories.  Regression results show that mobile phones, radios and TV-sets have a higher likelihood of ownership than welfare appliances (refrigerator and laundry machine) by low-income households.

kw4tq,"Dynamics of liquid argon flow around carbon nanotube","In this work non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to investigate the liquid argon flow passing a stationary carbon nanotube and to estimate kinetic energy of the flow and flow forces exerted on the nanotube. Effects of different factors were also investigated. CFD simulations of flow around a circular cylinder were also performed to compare the results with those of MD around the carbon nanotube. In molecular dynamics simulation, the fluid forces on the body are calculated directly from the summation of the molecular forces exerted on solid atoms by fluid atoms. In this work, this method is used to investigate the effects of different flow parameters such as flow velocity, flow temperature on the flow behavior over the carbon nanotube, atom positioning around the nanotube and forces exerted on it. The simulation is 3D, and the computational domain consists of a maximum of 33,700 liquid argon atoms as the fluid and 240 atoms of carbon which represent the solid nanotube. A single-walled carbon nanotube is simulated as a rigid body of fixed carbon atoms, and both argon-argon and argon-carbon interactions are modeled by the standard Lennard-Jonnes potential function. Flow is driven by rescaling fluid particles velocities at the inlet region with a length of 3% of the domain length in that direction every 50-time steps. Based on the information given, a parallel code was developed, and investigations have been conducted using this code. Results show that among all the parameters which were investigated in this paper, the flow velocity has the most significant effects on the exerted forces and kinetic energy on the carbon nanotube and the drag force is increased with an increment of the flow inlet velocity in all cases. Lift fluctuates around zero in all cases of the stationary carbon nanotube. Inlet flow velocities and temperatures have also changed atoms positioning in the vicinity of the nanotube and so atomic density in the nearby bins which is used to further clarify the difference in the drag force.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e7e6010ec780100219ce4f8/,129,https://engrxiv.org/kw4tq/,10.31224/osf.io/kw4tq,,2020-03-27T21:31:23.143665,2020-03-27T21:32:08.239195
8mf46,"Energy justice, built environment and poverty: A deep-narrative analysis of energy cultures in Brazil, India and Nigeria for policy modelling","Distributive energy justice as a policy instrument is crucial to meet UN-SDG 7 targets at the poorest section of rapidly urbanising Global South. This study mobilised this policy instrument to derive poverty alleviation focal points across slum rehabilitation housing in Brazil, India and Nigeria. It emphasises on the social dimensions of energy services which currently remains a literature gap. The core methodological innovation lies in the nested deep narrative analysis approach using topic modelling and grounded theory, developed in Debnath et. al. (2020). This paper presents the application of this methodology through the analysis of energy culture and built environment in poverty. Narratives of poverty and energy services were collected through focus group discussions that served as the primary data object. Topic modelling was performed to remove directionality biases in the narratives using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)-based algorithm, which was then strengthen using grounded theory. Cross-validation of the topic models was performed using science-mapping of state-of-the-art literature in ‘energy justice’ and ‘poverty’ with an LDA-tuning algorithm.

aj4wm,"Influence of Strain Rate Sensitivity on Localization and Void Coalescence","The onset of macroscopic strain localization limits the ductility of many ductile materials. For porous ductile materials, two distinct mechanisms of macroscopic localization have been identified: void growth induced softening and void coalescence. In this work we focus on analyzing the influence of material's strain rate sensitivity (SRS) on the two mechanisms of macroscopic localization or ductile failure as a function of the imposed stress triaxiality. To this end, three dimensional finite element calculations of unit cells have been carried out to model void growth and coalescence in an infinite block containing a periodic distribution of initially spherical voids in a band. The matrix material of the unit cell is considered to follow a strain rate dependent elastic perfectly plastic flow response. The unit cell calculations are carried out for a range of SRS parameter, imposed stress triaxiality and initial orientations of the voided band. Our results show that both the critical porosity and strain at the onset of localization and coalescence are strongly influenced by the SRS parameter and the imposed stress triaxiality values. Furthermore, the relative effect of the SRS parameter is found to increases with the increasing value of the imposed stress triaxiality.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e7a082fd2927f0035dd8042/,92,https://engrxiv.org/aj4wm/,10.31224/osf.io/aj4wm,10.1016/j.ijplas.2019.09.007,2020-03-26T12:27:44.307254,2020-03-26T12:28:06.378620
9bkxc,"Influence of Grain Size Distribution on Ductile Intergranular Crack Growth Resistance","The influence of grain size distribution on ductile intergranular crack growth resistance is investigated using full-field microstructure-based finite element calculations and a simpler model based on discrete unit events and graph search. The finite element calculations are carried out for a plane strain slice with planar grains subjected to mode I small-scale yielding conditions. The finite element formulation accounts for finite deformations, and the constitutive relation models the loss of stress carrying capacity due to progressive void nucleation, growth, and coalescence. The discrete unit events are characterized by a set of finite element calculations for crack growth at a single-grain boundary junction. A directed graph of the connectivity of grain boundary junctions and the distances between them is used to create a directed graph in J-resistance space. For a specified grain boundary distribution, this enables crack growth resistance curves to be calculated for all possible crack paths. Crack growth resistance curves are calculated based on various path choice criteria and compared with the results of full-field finite element calculations of the initial boundary value problem. The effect of unimodal and bimodal grain size distributions on intergranular crack growth is considered. It is found that a significant increase in crack growth resistance is obtained if the difference in grain sizes in the bimodal grain size distribution is sufficiently large.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e7a032ad2927f0033dd7aba/,152,https://engrxiv.org/9bkxc/,10.31224/osf.io/9bkxc,10.1115/1.4045073,2020-03-24T13:11:51.784025,2020-03-24T13:12:00.805907
exhbs,"Intergranular Fracture Prediction and Microstructure Design","A model based on discrete unit events coupled with a graph search algorithm is developed to predict intergranular fracture. The model is based on two hypotheses: (i) the key unit event associated with intergranular crack propagation is the interaction of a grain boundary crack with a grain boundary segment located at an angle with the initial crack plane; and (ii) for a given crack path, the overall crack growth resistance can be calculated using the crack growth resistance of a collection of unit events. Next, using a directed graph containing the connectivity of grain boundary junctions and the distances between them, and crack deflection versus crack growth resistance data, a directed graph in the J-resistance space is created. This graph contains information on the crack growth resistance for all possible crack paths in a given grain microstructure. Various crack growth resistance curves are then calculated including those corresponding to: (i) a local resistance minimum; (ii) a global minimum; and (iii) for verification, a path specified by microstructure-based finite element calculations. The results show that the proposed method based on discrete unit events and graph search can predict the crack path and the crack growth resistance for cracks that propagate from one grain boundary junction to another. The proposed computationally inexpensive model can be used to design material microstructures with improved intergranular fracture resistance, and/or to assess the overall crack growth resistance of materials with a known distribution of grain morphology.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e7a00dcd2927f0033dd776b/,115,https://engrxiv.org/exhbs/,10.31224/osf.io/exhbs,10.1007/s10704-019-00347-z,2020-03-24T13:10:59.174247,2020-03-24T13:11:23.104745
s6epj,"On the micromechanism of inclusion driven ductile fracture and its implications on fracture toughness","The objective is to identify the micromechanism(s) of ductile crack advance, and isolate
the key microstructural and material parameters that a?ect these micromechanisms and
fracture toughness of ductile structural materials. Three dimensional, ?nite element, ?nite
deformation, small scale yielding calculations of mode I crack growth are carried out for
ductile material matrix containing two populations of void nucleating particles using an
elasto-viscoplastic constitutive framework for progressively cavitating solid. The larger par-
ticles or inclusions that result in void nucleation at an early stage are modeled discretely
while smaller particles that require large strains to nucleate voids are homogeneously dis-
tributed. The size, spacing and volume fraction of inclusions introduce microstructure-based
length-scales. In the calculations, ductile crack growth is computed and fracture toughness is
characterized. Several features of crack growth behavior and dependence of fracture tough-
ness on microstructural and material parameters observed in experiments, naturally emerge
in our calculations. The extent to which the microstructural and material parameters a?ect
the micromechanisms of ductile crack advance and, hence, the macroscopic fracture tough-

jtvrd,"Correlating fracture toughness and fracture surface roughness via correlation length scale","Fracture toughness of a material depends on its microstructure and the imposed loading conditions. Intuitively, the resultant fracture surfaces must contain the information about the interlacing of these intrinsic (microstructure) and extrinsic (imposed loading) characteristics. Mandelbrot’s revelation that fracture surfaces are fractals, excited both the scientific and engineering communities, spurring a series of works focused at correlating the fracture toughness and the fracture surface roughness. Unfortunately, these studies remained inconclusive and later on it was shown that the fractal dimension of the fracture surface roughness is in fact universal. Here, we show that by going beyond the universality, a definite correlation between the fracture toughness and indices of the fracture surface roughness is obtained. To this end, fracture experiments on an aluminum alloy were carried over a wide range of loading rates (10-2 – 106  ), and the resulting fracture surface were reconstructed using stereography. The correlation lengths, extracted from the reconstructed surfaces, were found to be linearly correlated with the measured fracture toughness. The correlation unraveled in our work, along with the proposed mechanistic interpretation, revives the hope of correlating fracture toughness and fracture surface roughness, allowing quantitative failure analysis and a potential reconstructive approaches to designing fracture resistant materials.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e7881044a60a5069dbb2020/,84,https://engrxiv.org/jtvrd/,10.31224/osf.io/jtvrd,10.1007/s10704-019-00377-7,2020-03-23T12:31:10.359697,2020-03-23T12:31:49.277891

ywkfr,"Traffic Assignment Problem with Strict Capacity Constraints","To improve the performance of the transportation network operation, traffic assignment problems require more reliable results. Disregard the solution method, one factor that leads to more accurate results in traffic assignment problems is considering the link capacity constraints. In traffic assignment problems, techniques such as the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm has extensive applications, but not considering link capacity in these methods results in inaccurate outputs. In every iteration of FW, move direction is obtained by solving the minimum cost flow problem for the network without considering the capacity constraints, which is named the all or nothing assignment algorithm. On the contrary, there is another algorithm called the Out of kilter (OFK) algorithm that solves the traffic assignment problem by minimizing the cost flow problem in networks with link capacity constraints. In this dissertation, the movement direction of the FW algorithm is obtained by the OFK algorithm. Therefore, in every iteration, link flows are lower than or equal to their capacities. In this method, we assume that the network has a circulation form, meaning that all origins are pure origin, and all destinations are the pure destination. Moreover, the results of the proposed algorithm for the Hearn and Sioux Falls transportation networks are presented and compared to the condition that link capacities are considered infinite.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e7523540cd06c05a400117d/,111,https://engrxiv.org/ywkfr/,10.31224/osf.io/ywkfr,,2020-03-20T20:33:48.496371,2020-04-04T20:45:55.945407

In this work, a Phase Field model has been proposed to study the first stages of transference. Simulations and experimental shadowgraphy images for BA-LIFT of water-glycerol mixtures have been compared. The transference mechanism is ideally only mechanical, but it does not explain some observed effects that have already been described for direct LIFT transference. Given its analogy with direct LIFT processes, four causes have been studied: direct interaction between laser and fluid, thermal conduction, a mechanical rebound, or pressure fall due to fluid velocity. After the analysis, the first three explanations have been rejected, and a hypothesis is proposed: the velocity field generated by the blister generates a cavitation bubble in the interface between the polyimide layer and the fluid. The inclusion of the effects of a cavitation bubble in the numerical model –in the form of a second push– is enough to replicate these secondary effects observed that take place at intermediate times in BA-LIFT.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e74ad930cd06c055d0028bc/,55,https://engrxiv.org/6dkv2/,10.31224/osf.io/6dkv2,,2020-03-20T17:37:55.819855,2020-03-20T17:38:41.739358
kgxr7,"Attaining stable electrolyzer operation under multi-annual climatic variations in almost fully renewable electricity systems: the case of Sweden","Hydrogen produced from renewable electricity can play an important role in deep decarbonization of industry, such as primary steel-making. 
However, adding large electrolyzer capacities to a low-carbon electricity system also increases the need for additional renewable electricity generation which will mostly come from variable renewable energies (VRE). 
This will require hydrogen production to be variable, unless sufficient flexibility is provided by other sources. 
Existing sources of flexibility in hydro-thermal systems are (a) hydropower and (b) thermal generation. 
However, increasing the flexibility of hydropower generation may have negative consequences for river ecosystems and the use of fossil and non-fossil fuels in generation may increase if thermal power is increasingly used to balance short-falls in wind power during electrolyzer operation. 
We assess here for our Swedish case study the utilization of electrolyzers with a dispatch model, assuming that additional VRE generation matches the additional electricity demand of hydrogen production on average. 
The flexibility of hydropower and thermal generation is restricted in four scenarios, and we run our model for 29 different weather years to test the impact of variable weather regimes. 
We show that (a) in all scenarios, electrolyzer utilization is above 60% on average, (b) the inter-annual variability of hydrogen production is very high if thermal power is not dispatched for electrolysis, (c) this problem is aggravated if hydropower flexibility is also restricted, and therefore (d) either long-term storage of hydrogen, backup hydrogen sources, or additional flexibility measures may be necessary to guarantee continuous hydrogen flows, and (e) adding wind power and electrolysis decreases the need for other backup flexibility measures in the system during climatic extreme events.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e747a7e0cd06c05470047fe/,152,https://engrxiv.org/kgxr7/,10.31224/osf.io/kgxr7,,2020-03-20T17:36:09.514263,2020-04-27T09:05:18.383748

As shear wall resist major portions of lateral loads in the lowest portions of the buildings and the frame supports the lateral loads in the upper portions of the building which is suited for soft storey high rise building.

In this present study, main focus is to determine the solution for shear walls behavior in multi-storey building. Effectiveness of shear walls has been studied with the help of six different models. Model one is bare frame structural system, model two is dual frame structural system and model three is a complete shear wall structural system with internal walls in y-direction and model four is a similar model having internal shear walls in x-direction, model five is again a dual frame having columns at exterior and shear walls in interior placed in y-direction and model six is also an dual frame structure having columns at exterior and shear walls at interior placed in x-direction.

In our approach, a next-best-view (NBV) planner plans an optimal action-observation-sequence to maximize the expected cost-performance for a visual route classification task. A difficulty arises from the fact that the NBV planner is trained and tested in different domains (times of day, weather conditions, and seasons). Existing NBV methods may be confused and deteriorated by the domain-shifts, and require significant efforts for adapting them to a new domain. We address this issue by a novel deep convolutional neural network (DNN) -based NBV planner that does not require the adaptation. Our main contributions in this paper are summarized as follows: (1) We present a novel domain-invariant NBV planner that is specifically tailored for DNN-based VPR. (2) We formulate the active VPR as a POMDP problem and present a feasible solution to address the inherent intractability. Specifically, the probability distribution vector (PDV) output by the available DNN is used as a domain-invariant observation model without the need to retrain it.

ea2np,"Technology for monitoring everyday prosthesis use: a systematic review","Background
Understanding how prostheses are used in everyday life is central to the design, provision and evaluation of prosthetic devices and associated services. This paper reviews the scientific literature on methodologies and technologies that have been used to assess the daily use of both upper- and lower-limb prostheses. It discusses the types of studies that have been undertaken, the technologies used to monitor physical activity, the benefits of monitoring daily living and the barriers to long-term monitoring.
Methods
A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL and EMBASE of studies that monitored the activity of prosthesis-users during daily-living.
Results
60 lower-limb studies and 9 upper-limb studies were identified for inclusion in the review. The first studies in the lower-limb field date from the 1990s and the number has increased steadily since the early 2000s. In contrast, the studies in the upper-limb field have only begun to emerge over the past few years. The early lower-limb studies focused on the development or validation of actimeters, algorithms and/or scores for activity classification. However, most of the recent lower-limb studies used activity monitoring to compare prosthetic components. The lower-limb studies mainly used step-counts as their only measure of activity, focusing on the amount of activity, not the type and quality of movements. In comparison, the small number of upper-limb studies were fairly evenly spread between development of algorithms, comparison of everyday activity to clinical scores, and comparison of different prosthesis user populations. Most upper-limb papers reported the degree of symmetry in activity levels between the arm with the prosthesis and the intact arm.
Conclusions
Activity monitoring technology used in conjunction with clinical scores and user feedback, offers significant insights into how prostheses are used and whether they meet the user’s requirements. However, the cost, limited battery-life and lack of availability in many countries mean that using sensors to understand the daily use of prostheses and the types of activity being performed has not yet become a feasible standard clinical practice. This review provides recommendations for the research and clinical communities to advance this area for the benefit of prosthesis users.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e6933430cd06c00b90052ea/,260,https://engrxiv.org/ea2np/,10.31224/osf.io/ea2np,,2020-03-11T19:26:59.963833,2020-03-11T19:51:54.234008

r9p2f,"A Review of Sensing and Communication, Human Factors, and Controller Aspects for Information-Aware Connected and Automated Vehicles","Information-aware connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have drawn great attention in recent years due to their potentially significant positive impacts on roadway safety and operational efficiency. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth review of three basic and key interrelated aspects of a CAV: sensing and communication technologies; human factors; and information-aware controller design. First, the different vehicular sensing and communication technologies and their protocol stacks, to provide reliable information to the information-aware CAV controller, are thoroughly discussed. Diverse human factors, such as user comfort, preferences, and reliability, to design the CAV systems for mass adaptation are also discussed. Then, the different layers of a CAV controller (route planning, driving mode execution, and driving model selection) considering human factors and information through connectivity are reviewed. In addition, the critical challenges for the sensing and communication technologies, human factors, and information-aware controller are identified to support the design of a safe and efficient CAV system while considering user acceptance and comfort. Finally, the promising future research directions of these three aspects are discussed to overcome existing challenges to realize a safe and operationally efficient CAV.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e658327a09645031205215e/,115,https://engrxiv.org/r9p2f/,10.31224/osf.io/r9p2f,10.1109/TITS.2019.2892399,2020-03-09T07:54:34.212593,2020-03-09T07:55:01.853269

This effect has been thought to be due to the shear type wave coincidence effect. In this work, the dispersion properties of thick panels are precisely investigated to get a right explanation for this phenomenon and to determine conditions in which this phenomenon occurs. It is also shown that lowering the stiffness of the panels is not always an effective approach to improving the transmission loss for thick panels though the approach is well-known to be effective for thin panels and has been also proposed for thick panels.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e63508e0f987d029949442d/,101,https://engrxiv.org/29tcr/,10.31224/osf.io/29tcr,,2020-03-07T08:20:54.399042,2020-03-07T08:21:24.819228
4nqcx,"Design and predicting performance of carbon nanotube reinforced cementitious materials : mechanical properties and dipersion characteristics.","Recently, Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) are drawing considerable attention of researchers for reinforcing cementitious materials due to their excellent mechanical properties and high aspect ratio (length-to-diameter ratio). However, CNTs might not disperse well within the cement matrix, resulting in little improvement or even degradation of concrete properties. The uncertainty in producing the consistent results in different studies might be attributed to multiple interactions between the experimental variables affecting the nanotube dispersion and the final properties of CNT-cement nanocomposites. Therefore, this research mainly focused on proposing equations that can reliably capture these interactions in order to correlate CNT dispersion with the mechanical properties. The main experimental variables studied included CNT concentration, aspect ratio, ultrasonication energy, ultrasonication amplitude, surfactant-to-CNTs ratio, water-to-cement ratio, sand-to-cement ratio, and hydration age of specimen. The study reported in this research was conducted in two parts: experimental program and modeling. In the experimental part of this research, a total of 63 different mix proportions were used to evaluate the flowability, mechanical properties, and durability characteristics of cement pastes and mortars containing CNTs. Using experimental test results reported in this study and the literature, three critical relations were proposed to consider the CNT dispersion, cement matrix composition, and hydration age of cement. The proposed critical relations were then added to available theoretical models in the literature. The flexural strength and elastic modulus of CNT-cement nanocomposites were predicted through a state-of-the-art probabilistic model using a Bayesian methodology. Finally, the developed probabilistic models were used to identify the optimum ranges of the experimental variables to maximize the mechanical properties. This was done through computing the conditional probability of not meeting the specified design requirement. The experimental results indicated that addition of CNTs could significantly improve different properties of cementitious materials, if the optimum range of each variable was used. Also, to achieve the desired mechanical properties, various combinations of the experimental variables might be used. The proposed prediction models were shown to capture the interactions between the experimental variables for predicting the mechanical properties within ±15% and ±18% of the experimental test results for flexural strength and elastic modulus, respectively. Based on the findings of this research, contour plots were developed to provide practical guidelines for future engineers to design CNT-cement nanocomposites.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e605dd3a0964500da053c58/,146,https://engrxiv.org/4nqcx/,10.31224/osf.io/4nqcx,10.18297/etd/3255,2020-03-05T07:44:20.374148,2020-07-06T20:09:11.446977

In this paper, I will present experiences from my implementation of active learning in sophomore-level Mechanical Engineering thermodynamics classes using Jupyter Notebooks. Jupyter Notebooks are a web-based programming environment widely used in software and other industries that allows students to combine code with equations and explanations of their work. By using this software to solve open-ended design problems, students move from the Remember, Comprehend, and Apply steps of Bloom’s Taxonomy to the Analyze, Synthesize, and Evaluate stages. Successfully integrating Jupyter Notebooks with these classes has required a shift in the focus of contact hours, going from didactic presentation of material to active practice with problem-solving techniques; most class material has been moved online.

tq3nx,"Electropolishing of surfaces in metallic parts obtained by Additive Manufacturing","In this paper a study of the process of Electropolishing (EP) to be applied to metallic parts obtained by Additive Manufacturing is presented. The roughness of parts obtained by Additive Manufacturing is not acceptable in many applications and consequently they require a postprocessing stage to improve the surface roughness of these parts. If the material hardness is very high, like in Stainless Steels, the process of mechanical grinding is not suitable, since there is an important wear in the tool and residual stresses can be generated in the part. EP is a process in which the roughness required is obtained without tool-part contact. The conditions for this process in 17-4PH and 316 Stainless Steel parts with a Tungsten or Lead electrode are worked out in order to achieve a fast and effective smoothing process. DC voltage and an electrolyte of H3PO4 and H2SO4 are used between the tool, which acts as the cathode, and the part, which is the anode. A micropositioning system is used to set the interelectrode gap to the optimum value. Decrease in roughness Ra from 12 m to values about 3 m with this process was achieved.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e5e3ceee89033009ef04e00/,48,https://engrxiv.org/tq3nx/,10.31224/osf.io/tq3nx,,2020-03-03T11:36:00.604628,2020-03-03T11:36:29.586279

dx79t,"Experimental characterisation of the thermal energy released by a Radio-Frequency Corona Igniter in Nitrogen and Air","The Radio-Frequency Corona Ignition System is characterised by a wide initial combustion volume and precursors production, via radical insemination by the streamers, in addition to high released thermal energy. These features lead to faster combustion, a higher tolerance for lean mixtures and EGR dilutions and, in general, more adaptability. The thermal energy released by the igniter to the surrounding medium can help to understand the performance, the behaviour and the application range. This paper proposes a systematic experimental analysis of the thermal energy released by the igniter at room temperature, via pressure-based calorimetry. This analysis, carried out at different pressures (up to 10 bar) and medium type (air or nitrogen), is extended to the whole range of the corona igniter control parameters, namely streamer duration and driving voltage. The latter is proportional to the maximum electrode voltage, as shown in the model here presented, and as confirmed by experiments. The results show, for all the vessel pressures, the high energetic efficiency of the ignition system and the high amount of the released energy. The latter is found to increase linearly with the corona streamers duration and quickly with the driving voltage up to the streamer-to-arc transition threshold. The efficiency tends to reach a defined upper limit. For each tested point, the energy released to pure nitrogen is higher than to air, which evidences the impact of the oxygen presence under streamer exposure.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e5d1d53ef5d89025b06b2f4/,149,https://engrxiv.org/dx79t/,10.31224/osf.io/dx79t,10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.114617,2020-03-02T15:59:56.538157,2020-03-02T16:00:32.446163

jph63,"Negshell casting: 3D-printed structured and sacrificial cores for soft robot fabrication","Soft robot fabrication by casting liquid elastomer often requires multiple steps of casting or skillful manual labor. We present a novel soft robotic fabrication technique: negshell casting  (negative-space eggshell casting), that reduces the steps required for fabrication by introducing 3D-printed thin-walled cores for use in casting that are meant to be left in place instead of being removed later in the fabrication process. Negshell casting consists of two types of cores: sacrificial cores (negshell cores) and structural cores. Negshell cores are designed to be broken into small pieces that have little effect on the mechanical structure of the soft robot, and can be used for creating fluidic channels and bellows for actuation. Structural cores, on the other hand, are not meant to be broken, and are for increasing the stiffness of soft robotic structures, such as endoskeletons. We describe the design and fabrication concepts for both types of cores and report the mechanical characterization of the cores embedded in silicone rubber specimens. We also present an example use-case of negshell casting for a single joint soft robotic finger, along with an experiment to demonstrate how negshell casting concepts can aid in force transmission. Finally, we present real-world usage of negshell casting in a 6 degree-of-freedom three-finger soft robotic gripper, and a demonstration of the gripper in a robotic pick-and-place task.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e597e86ef5d89016c069bd1/,71,https://engrxiv.org/jph63/,10.31224/osf.io/jph63,,2020-02-29T16:34:02.323937,2020-02-29T17:18:47.223525
ysgp4,"Bayesian machine learning for the prognosis of combustion instabilities from noise","Experiments are performed on a turbulent swirling flame placed inside a vertical tube whose fundamental acoustic mode becomes unstable at higher powers and equivalence ratios. The power, equivalence ratio, fuel composition and boundary condition of this tube are varied and, at each operating point, the combustion noise is recorded. In addition, short acoustic pulses at the fundamental frequency are supplied to the tube with a loudspeaker and the decay rates of subsequent acoustic oscillations are measured. This quantifies the linear stability of the system at every operating point. Using this data for training, we show that it is possible for a Bayesian ensemble of neural networks to predict the decay rate from a 300 millisecond sample of the (un-pulsed) combustion noise and therefore forecast impending thermoacoustic instabilities. We also show that it is possible to recover the equivalence ratio and power of the flame from these noise snippets, confirming our hypothesis that combustion noise indeed provides a fingerprint of the combustor’s internal state. Furthermore, the Bayesian nature of our algorithm enables principled estimates of uncertainty in our predictions, a reassuring feature that prevents it from making overconfident extrapolations. We use the techniques of permutation importance and integrated gradients to understand which features in the combustion noise spectra are crucial for accurate predictions and how they might influence the prediction. This study serves as a first step towards establishing interpretable and Bayesian machine learning techniques as tools to discover informative relationships in combustor data and thereby build trustworthy, robust and reliable combustion diagnostics.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e596c8bb070fc015ae5b075/,276,https://engrxiv.org/ysgp4/,10.31224/osf.io/ysgp4,,2020-02-29T16:30:24.974888,2020-03-18T03:18:55.745777

Although the PCD model is effective, a PCD model requires considerable amount of class-specific training examples and class-set maintenance in long-term large-scale VPR scenarios. Therefore, we propose to employ a DCN as a landmark-class detector (LCD), which allows to distinguish exponentially large numbers of different places by combining multiple landmarks, and furthermore, allows to select a stable part of the scenes (such as buildings) as landmark classes to reduce the need for class-set maintenance. However, the following important questions remain. 1) How we should mine such training examples (landmark objects) even when we have no domain-specific object detector? 2) How we should fine-tune the architecture and parameters of the DCN to a new domain-specific landmark set? To answer these questions, we present a self-supervised landmark mining approach for collecting pseudo-labeled landmark examples, and then consider the network architecture search (NAS) on the LCD task, which has significantly larger search space than typical NAS applications such as PCD. Extensive verification experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework to previous LCD methods with hand-crafted architectures and/or non-adaptive parameters, and 90% reduction in NAS cost compared with the naive NAS implementation.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e590c12ef5d890138069cf4/,133,https://engrxiv.org/26xnj/,10.31224/osf.io/26xnj,,2020-02-28T18:34:31.142685,2020-02-28T18:34:42.846605

Background: Finite element (FE) modelling has long been proposed to support the design of prosthetics sockets. However, there is minimal detail in the literature to inform practice in developing and interpreting these complex, highly non-linear models. 
Objectives: To identify recommendations for best practice in FE modelling of lower limb prosthetics, considering key modelling approaches and inputs.
Methods: This study developed a parametric FE model using MRI data from a transtibial amputee. Sensitivity analyses were performed upon socket loading methods, socket-residuum interface parameters and soft tissue material models from the literature, to quantify their effect on the biomechanical response of the residual limb to a range of parameterised socket designs. 
Results: It was found that these variables had a marked impact on the predicted response of the FE model, especially with regards to the interfacial pressure and shear distribution. 
Conclusions: All modelling decisions should be justified biomechanically and clinically:
- consider the effects of donning and interface friction to capture the shear stresses 
- use representative stiffness hyperelastic material models for soft tissues when using strain to predict injury; and 
- interrogate models comparatively, against a clinically-used control

However, simulation validation has historically relied on comparison with surrogate quantities like force and displacement due to barriers to direct strain measurement–most notably, the small spatial scale of these devices. We demonstrate the use of microscale two-dimensional digital image correlation (2D-DIC) to directly characterize full-field surface strains on a nitinol device coupon under emulated physiological loading. Experiments are performed using a digital optical microscope and a custom, temperature-controlled load frame. Following applicable recommendations from the International DIC Society, hardware and environmental heating studies, noise floor analyses, and in- and out-of-plane rigid body translation studies are first performed to characterize the microscale DIC setup. Uniaxial tension experiments are also performed using a polymeric test specimen up to nominal stains of 5%. Sub-millimeter fields of view and sub-micron displacement accuracies (9 nm mean error) are achieved, and systematic (mean) and random (standard deviation) errors in strain are each estimated to be approximately 1,000 μϵ. The system is then demonstrated by acquiring measurements at the root of a 300 μm-wide nitinol device strut undergoing fixed-free cantilever bending motion. Lüders-like transformation bands are observed originating from the tensile side of the strut that spread toward the neutral axis at an angle of approximately 55°.

Video-based markerless motion capture is a user-friendly, inexpensive, and widely applicable technology that could reduce the barriers to measuring spatiotemporal gait parameters in clinical and more diverse settings. The aim of this work was to determine whether spatiotemporal gait parameters measured using Theia3D markerless motion capture demonstrate concurrent validity with those measured using marker-based motion capture. Thirty healthy adult participants performed treadmill walking at self-selected speeds while 2D video and marker-based motion capture data were collected simultaneously. Kinematic-based gait events were used to measure nine spatiotemporal gait parameters from both systems independently. The parameters were compared using their group means, Bland-Altman methods, Pearson correlation coefficients, paired-samples t-tests, and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC(A-1) and ICC(C-1)). Group means between systems were indistinguishable across all nine gait parameters, and the Bland-Altman plots showed no systematic biases or clinically meaningful differences between the systems. Pearson coefficients indicated near-perfect correlations (r ≥0.96) between systems for all but two parameters, which had strong correlations (double-limb support time, r=0.87; swing time, r=0.88). T-tests indicated differences in stance, swing, and double-limb support time parameters, but strong correlations were found for all ICCs, the lowest being 0.84 for both double-limb support time and swing time.

Such waves are governed by nonlinear coupled differential equations whose analytical solution is seldom trackable, hence emerges the need for suitable numerical solvers. Based on a finite-volume method in one space dimension, we here develop a designated scheme for nonlinear waves with two coupled components that propagate in soft laminates. We apply our scheme to a periodic laminate made of two alternating compressible Gent layers, and consider two cases. In one case, we analyze a motion whose component along the lamination direction is coupled to a component in the layers plane, and discover vector solitary waves in a continuum medium. In the second case, we analyze a motion with two coupled components in the plane of the layers, and observe a train of linearly polarized solitary waves, followed by a single circularly polarized wave.

fyw82,"Optimal implementation of frequency domain impedances in time domain simulations of building structures on embedded foundations","Soil-Structure Interaction (SSI) have been studied the last decades, and proper analysis for the linear elastic case in frequency domain has been established successfully. However, SSI is rarely considered in the seismic design of building structures. Regardless of its importance as a significant source of flexibility and energy dissipation, buildings are analyzed using a rigid base assumption, and the design is based on a response spectrum analysis, for which not only the soil, but also time are totally ignored. In a first attempt to improve and to incentivize time domain analyzes compatible with standard finite element packages for the engineering community, the state-of-practice introduces two major simplifications to transform the frequency domain analysis into a time domain analysis: (a) it assumes the frequency at which the impedance value should be read is the flexible-base frequency, and (b) it also assumes that the foundation input motion preserves the phase of the free field motion. Upon these simplifications, the following questions may arise: How does NIST recommendations perform in overall against a full finite element model? Are the embedment effects for shallow foundation not important so that the phase angle can be neglected? What is the best dimensionless frequency to estimate the soil impedance? Is it possible to make a better estimation of the dimensionless frequency to increase the NIST accuracy?

db7jv,"Geometrical Optics applied to 1D Site Response of Inhomogeneous Soil Deposits","The technique referred as Geometrical Optics entails considering the wave propagation in a heterogeneous
medium as if it happened with infinitely small wavelength. This classic simplification allows to obtain useful approximate analytical results in cases where complete description of the waveform behavior is virtually unattainable, hence its wide use in Physics. This approximation is also commonly termed Ray Theory, and it has already been thoroughly applied in Seismology. This text presents an application of Geometrical Optics to 1D Site Response (1DSR): it is used herein to, first, explain
and elucidate the generality of some previous observations and results; second, to partially settle an open question in 1DSR, namely “what are the equivalent homogeneous properties that yield the same response, in terms of natural frequencies and resonance amplitude, for a certain inhomogeneous site?”, provided few assumptions.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e4b1bf3b8c2e500194c6770/,152,https://engrxiv.org/db7jv/,10.31224/osf.io/db7jv,,2020-02-18T09:21:30.318098,2020-07-07T18:03:44.870147

vcy35,"Recycled Asphalt Shingle Modified Asphalt Mixture Design and Performance Evaluation","The inclusion of recycled asphalt shingles (RAS) in asphalt mixtures has become increasingly common; however, the underlying design principles vary significantly by agency. The primary objectives of this study included: (1) evaluating the ‘binder availability’ concept for RAS mixtures through a carefully designed laboratory experiment; (2) demonstrating a balanced mixture performance testing approach for the design of RAS mixtures; and (3) evaluating the field data of RAS mixtures placed in the Midwest region of the U.S. Three asphalt mixture designs with RAS contents of 0.0, 2.5 and 5.0%, which were designed to have nearly identical volumetric characteristics, were investigated. The binder availability was determined to be approximately 100% in the two RAS mixtures considered. In addition, Hamburg wheel tracking and disk-shaped compact tension tests were conducted to evaluate the high- and low-temperature mixture performance. As expected, the addition of RAS significantly improved the rutting resistance. DC(T) test results demonstrated that a soft base binder effectively permitted the design of thermal-crack-resistant RAS mixtures. Field investigations indicated that the performance of pavement surfaces containing RAS was similar to that of surfaces containing only reclaimed asphalt pavement or virgin materials. This study also highlights a performance-engineered mix design approach, which is currently being adopted by several agencies in the Midwest (e.g. Illinois Tollway, Missouri DOT, etc.) and can provide mix designers a reliable approach for designing innovative asphalt mixtures with higher recycling levels and a modern, heterogeneous composition. Furthermore, the proposed approach may prove to be a simpler, more mixture-centric alternative to the primary method suggested in AASHTO PP78-17, which recommends arbitrary VMA bumping plus binder extraction, recovery, and advanced binder testing.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e44a3c6d662210039992c1e/,130,https://engrxiv.org/vcy35/,10.31224/osf.io/vcy35,,2020-02-13T09:42:29.736657,2020-02-13T15:38:31.835943

Sand production simulation geometry and procedure are proposed, in which the cone penetration test (CPT) has been used to investigate a physical perforation penetration of the cemented sandstone material with the real-world grain size distribution from the Ustyurt-Buzachi Sedimentary Basin. The Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) was adapted for the sand production simulation geometry to simulate the fluid flow near the well casing. Oil with low viscosity and density was used as an injection fluid (reservoir fluid). Erosion near the perforation tunnel due to the pressure drawdown was examined, where the production of sand particles was initiated during the first flow due to the drag force that lifted the sand particles from the perforation damage zone. At the beginning of the simulation a sand arch was captured around the perforation tunnel and due to the fluid flow it collapsed and perforation cavity became larger.

Utilising local residual biomass as a raw material may be advantageous in terms of sustainability. This study investigated the environmental and energy balances of using biowaste and biomass from landscape management for micropollutant removal at a commercial scale WWTP. Both residual biomasses were processed using the integrated generation of solid fuel and biogas from biomass (IFBB) technique to obtain a press cake that was used as feedstock for AC production. The results showed a lower global warming potential (GWP) and cumulative energy demand in comparison to a fossil-based conventional AC. Differences in GWP between residual and fossil ACs were enhanced when the end-of-life incineration step was considered, and residual AC had a lower social risk associated with its production. Energy efficiency of AC production was substantially increased by utilising waste heat generated in the pyrolysis process of biochar and by using electricity generated in a combined heat and power plant using biogas from the methanation of IFBB press fluids. Converting residual biomass into activated carbon using IFBB and a state-of-the-art pyrolysis and activation unit along with energy recovery would aid WWTPs to become self-sufficient in terms of raw materials and improve the sustainability of WWTPs.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e3c9eff032a4d0116e70ee2/,202,https://engrxiv.org/vsd73/,10.31224/osf.io/vsd73,10.1088/1748-9326/ab8330,2020-02-07T21:53:14.041561,2020-03-31T09:21:32.810141

6k3yh,"Maskless exposure device for photolithography","Photolithography plays a consequential role in transferring patterns from photomasks to substrates and thereby is an important tool in semiconductor, IC, MEMS and many microstructures’ production. The photomasks are preprinted prior to the photolithographic procedure with certain layouts, and these layouts are transferred to surfaces of materials like silicon during the lithography and finally these surfaces undergo chemical processes by which three dimensional micro features are formed. Therefore photomasks containing specific layouts are the inevitable components in the entire procedure, but unfortunately those are expensive in its nature together with time consuming production formalities. Some of the successful attempts to remove these difficulties are cost effective photomasks and maskless lithography.

A system named ‘Maskless Exposure Device’ (MED) is introduced here as my thesis related research and it is intended to replace the expensive photomasks. The device transfers images and layouts created on a computer, easily and effortlessly to different substrate surfaces and can be repeatedly used in photolithography by introducing new drawings on the computer screen and thereby, MED is nothing but a maskless lithographic technique.

The device can be mainly used in research and development applications in MEMS production, microfluidic systems, semiconductor and biosensor designs, patterning of cell culture substrates, electrode structures etc. Research on design of microsensors and microactuators could be confronted extremely cost effectively with maximum time saving considerations.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e3a6562f1369e00428abdbf/,180,https://engrxiv.org/6k3yh/,10.31224/osf.io/6k3yh,,2020-02-05T08:55:42.423601,2020-02-05T14:52:50.571410

s4kbn,"Selecting Appropriate 3D Scanning Technologies for Prosthetic Socket Design and Transtibial Residual Limb Shape Characterisation","Introduction: Plaster casting and manual rectification represent the benchmark prosthetic socket design method. 3D technologies have increasing potential for prosthetic limb design and fabrication, especially for enhancing access to these services in lower and middle income countries (LMICs). However, the community has a responsibility to verify the efficacy of these new digital technologies. This study’s objective was to assess the repeatability of plaster casting in vivo, specifically for clinically-relevant residuum shape and landmark capture, and to compare this with three clinically-used 3D scanners. 
Materials and Methods: A comparative reliability assessment of casting and 3D scanning was conducted in eleven participants with established transtibial amputation. For each participant, two positive moulds were cast by a prosthetist and digitised using a white light 3D surface scanner. Between casts, each participant’s residuum was scanned. The deviation between scan volumes, cross-sections and shapes was calculated.
Results: 95% of the clinically-relevant socket shape surface area had a deviation between manual casts &lt;2.87mm (S.D. 0.44mm). The average deviation by surface area was 0.18mm (S.D. 1.72mm). The repeatability coefficient of casting was 46.1ml (3.47%) for volume, and 9.6mm (3.53%) for perimeters. For all clinically-meaningful measures, greater reliability was observed for the Omega scanner, and worse for the Sense and iSense scanners, although it was observed that the Sense scanner performance was comparable to casting (95th percentile shape consistency). 
Conclusions: This study provides a platform to appraise new clinical shape capture technologies in the context of best practice in manual plaster casting, and starts the conversation of which 3D scanning devices are most appropriate for different types of clinical use. The methods and benchmark results may support prosthetists in acquiring and applying their clinical experience, as part of their continuing professional development.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e3962f2fa39b701e51db1b8/,242,https://engrxiv.org/s4kbn/,10.31224/osf.io/s4kbn,,2020-02-04T12:42:04.117039,2020-02-04T12:42:21.521977

An interaction of particles with a high Reynolds number turbulent gas flow accelerating to a nozzle, has not been characterized thoroughly. We study the particle-turbulence interactions in a two-dimensional model of a rocket engine. Two-phase particle image/tracking velocimetry provides the flow velocity simultaneously with the velocities of irregularly shaped inertial particles ($d_p \sim 350 \mu$m, Stokes $St \sim 70$, particle Reynolds number $Re_p \sim 300$). We reveal the local augmentation of turbulent fluctuations in the particle wakes (up to 5 particle diameters downstream the particle). Despite the low mass fraction, the large response time of the particles leads to an increase of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) everywhere in the chamber. The increase of local particle mass fraction near the nozzle, due to the mass conservation and converging streamlines, compensates for the dampening effect of the strong mean flow acceleration and further augments TKE at the nozzle inlet. Furthermore, this is accompanied by unexpectedly isotropic fluctuations in the proximity of the nozzle. The phenomenon of the isotropic, strongly enhanced turbulence in the proximity of the engine nozzle achievable with the low mass fraction of high $St,Re_p$ particles, can be used to improve the design of solid propellant rocket engines.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e3831f457427b01540c4153/,159,https://engrxiv.org/j86f7/,10.31224/osf.io/j86f7,,2020-02-03T16:36:12.379358,2020-06-18T19:50:53.464231

23s6f,"Fault-Diagnosing DCN-SLAM for 3D Change Object Detection: A Method based on Masking Input Images","Although image change detection (ICD) methods provide good detection accuracy for many scenarios, most of the existing methods rely on place-specific background modeling. The time/space cost for such place-specific models becomes prohibitive for large-scale scenarios, such as long-term robotic visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Therefore, we propose a novel ICD framework that is specifically tailored for long-term SLAM. This study is inspired by the multi-map-based SLAM framework, where N multiple localizers are capable of mutual diagnosis, thus not requiring any explicit background modeling/model. We extend this multi-map diagnosis approach toward a more generic single-map-based object-level diagnosis framework (i.e., ICD), where state-of-the-art self-localization systems can be used in their original form, which is as the change object indicator. The available single localizer is extended to different N localizers by introducing different N masked input images. Further, we also consider map diagnosis on a state-of-the-art deep-visual-SLAM system (rather than on conventional bag-of-words or landmark -based systems) in which the blackbox nature of the deep convolutional neural network (DCN) complicates the diagnosis problem. We also consider a 3D point cloud (PC) -based SLAM, and for the first time (to the best of our knowledge) adopt the state-of-the-art scan context PC descriptor for the purpose of map diagnosis.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e33b6ec4b2010010720f52b/,159,https://engrxiv.org/23s6f/,10.31224/osf.io/23s6f,,2020-01-31T12:15:09.142925,2020-01-31T12:15:21.471850
6qe2x,"Innovative Metaheuristic Algorithms for Efficient Berth Scheduling at Marine Container Terminals; Masoud Kavoosi; Dissertation; 2019","International trade plays a critical role for the global economy. A significant portion of general consumption goods is transported by vessels in a containerized form. Increasing volumes of the containerized trade impose additional pressure on marine container terminals (MCTs), which are responsible for service of incoming vessels from different liner shipping companies. MCTs are considered as important nodes in supply chains, as they allow transfer of containers from vessels to one of the alternative inland modes (generally, truck or rail). Managing operations within MCTs is a quite challenging task not only due to increasing seaborne trade volumes, but also due to increasing number of liner shipping alliances, deployment of megaships by liner shipping companies, inability to expand the terminal size due to spatial constraints, and other factors. Another important goal for the MCT operator is to ensure the timely service of vessels, as the vessel service delays may result in potential disruption of liner shipping schedules, and ultimately cause product delivery delays to the final customers.
This dissertation focuses on addressing complex decision problems, which are faced by the MCT operators. The seaside operations, which deal with loading and unloading of vessels, will be of a primary interest, as they affect the total turnaround time of vessels. The latter is considered as one of the key performance indicators for the MCT operations. As many of decision problems related to the seaside operations, cannot be solved using the exact optimization algorithms (e.g., Simplex, Branch-and-Bound, Brach-and-Cut) within a reasonable computational time for the realistic size problem instances, a number of metaheuristic algorithms will be proposed (with a primary focus on Evolutionary Algorithms, which have been widely used in different fields for solving combinatorial decision problems). The proposed metaheuristic algorithms are expected to serve as efficient decision making tools for the MCT operators and facilitate exchange of freight flows between water and inland transportation modes.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e31b2a9e71ef8010f189023/,250,https://engrxiv.org/6qe2x/,10.31224/osf.io/6qe2x,,2020-01-29T16:47:59.015525,2020-01-29T16:48:22.172451

8ybv6,"Modeling a Helical Fluid Inerter System with Time-Invariant Mem-Models","In this paper, experimental data from tests of a helical fluid inerter are used to model the observed hysteretic behaviour. The novel idea is to test the feasibility of employing mem-models, which are time-invariant herein, to capture the observed phenomena by using physically meaningful state variables. Firstly we use a Masing model concept, identified with a multilayer feedforward neural network to capture the physical characteristics of the hysteresis functions. Following this, a more refined approach based on the concept of a multi-element model including a mem-inerter is developed. This is compared with previous definitions in the literature and shown to be a more general model. Through-out this paper, numerical simulations are used to demonstrate the type of dynamic responses anticipated using the proposed time- invariant mem-models.

The approach is illustrated using data from a flow sheet for a toluene production chemical process [1], [2]. First, the maximum power that can be drawn from a stream carrying waste heat in the process is calculated. This heat is coupled with a supercritical working fluid Carnot engine and calculations are carried out to optimize the size and frequency of the engine. The impact of compression ratio, upper isotherm temperature, and engine pressure are considered. It is found that with a relatively small engine and frequency, on the order of 1.5 L and 50 Hz, having a moderate upper isotherm temperature and a compression ratio of 2, almost 1 million kWh of energy is recovered from a single waste stream, thereby reducing cooler loads, energy costs, and environmental emissions. The approach provides a novel computational adjunct for calculating the efficient potential recovery of waste heat in chemical process design.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2f2ce2e71ef8001a1884af/,146,https://engrxiv.org/qrgtz/,10.31224/osf.io/qrgtz,,2020-01-28T09:37:52.253101,2020-01-28T09:38:04.046878
cqynw,"Development of an MRI/FEA Framework for Analysis of Subject-Specific Aortic Compliance: Part II- Constitutive Law Development and Prediction of Heterogeneous vessel Composition and Deformation","This paper, the second of two parts, presents a novel subject-specific in-silico framework in which we uncover the relationship between the spatially varying constituents of the aorta and the non-linear compliance of the vessel during the cardiac cycle uncovered in Part I. In Part II a novel microstructurally motivated constitutive model is developed, and simulations reveal that internal vessel contractility, due to pre-stretched elastin and actively generated smooth muscle stress, must be incorporated, along with collagen strain stiffening, in order to accurately predict the non-linear pressure-area relationship observed in-vivo. Modelling of elastin and smooth muscle contractility allows for the identification of the reference vessel configuration at zero-lumen pressure, in addition to accurately predicting high- and low-compliance regimes under a physiological range of pressures. This modelling approach is also shown to capture the key features of elastin and SMC knockout experiments. The volume fractions of the constituent components of the aortic material model were computed so that the in-silico pressure-area curves accurately predict the corresponding MRI data at each location. Simulations reveal that collagen and smooth muscle volume fractions increase distally, while elastin volume fraction decreases distally, consistent with reported histological data. Furthermore, the strain at which collagen transitions from low to high stiffness is lower in the abdominal aorta, again supporting the histological finding that collagen waviness is lower in this distally.  The analyses presented in this paper provides new insights into the heterogeneous structure-function relationship that underlies aortic biomechanics. This novel subject-specific MRI/FEA methodology provides a foundation for personalised in-silico clinical analysis and tailored aortic device development.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2f19d387a1d902561ce449/,103,https://engrxiv.org/cqynw/,10.31224/osf.io/cqynw,,2020-01-28T09:35:19.577801,2020-02-05T17:10:34.118244
spzgd,"Development of an MRI/FEA framework for Analysis of Subject-Specific Aortic Compliance: Part I - Development of a dual-VENC 4D Flow MRI Protocol for Measurement of Heterogeneous non-linear vessel Deformation","Advancement of subject-specific in-silico medicine requires new imaging protocols tailored to specific anatomical features, paired with new constitutive model development based on structure/function relationships. In Part I of this two-part study we develop a new dual-VENC 4D Flow MRI protocol that provides unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution of in-vivo aortic deformation. Based on this dual-VENC subject-specific aortic imaging technique, in   Part II we develop a new finite element framework that uncovers the link between spatial variance in vessel composition and biomechanical function. The imaging protocol developed in Part I provides high sensitivity to all blood flow velocities throughout the entire cardiac cycle, overcoming the challenge of accurately measuring the highly unsteady non-uniform flow field in the aorta. Cross sectional area change, volumetric flow rate, and compliance are observed to decrease with distance from the heart, while pulse wave velocity is observed to increase. A non-linear aortic lumen pressure-area relationship is observed throughout the aorta, such that a high vessel compliance occurs during diastole, and a low vessel compliance occurs during systole. This clearly demonstrates that vessel compliance during a cardiac cycle cannot be simplistically represented by a single value. This high-resolution MRI data provides key information on the spatial variation in non-linear aortic compliance. In Part II we demonstrate that such subject-specific data facilitates the development of finite element simulations that directly predict the relationship between spatial variations in vessel composition and biomechanical function. This MRI/FEA framework significantly advances the state-of-the-art of in-silico diagnostic techniques for the human aorta.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2f172fc19c5d0246ee2cfc/,117,https://engrxiv.org/spzgd/,10.31224/osf.io/spzgd,,2020-01-28T09:34:08.268811,2020-01-28T09:34:22.291879
azuq9,"Resources Recovery from Electronic Waste","Printed Circuit Boards in electronic scrap are richest source of base and precious metals, promoting economic drive for metal recovery. Recovery of these metals is a difficult exercise due to complex nature of electronic waste. India is one of the leading electronic waste processing hubs where more than 95% recyclers are unorganised/non-formal, lacking such a recovery facility. An efficient metal recovery protocol with lesser environmental impact remains unavailable to unorganised recyclers. In current study, an attempt has been made to combine various hydrometallurgical methods to achieve efficient metal recovery from Printed Circuit Boards. Mimicking mineral processing protocols for metal recovery from electronic waste has been a key feature of presented research. Printed Circuit Boards of personal computers were reduced to a size ≤ 2.5 mm and were used as sample for metal recovery. Copper and silver were extracted by selective leaching using Nitric Acid. Maximum extraction efficiency of 96.8% and 99.9% were achieved for copper and silver respectively. Nitric Acid was extracted using solvent extraction method to minimize the environmental damage of remaining waste as well as for reuse in next leaching cycle. Electrodeposition of copper was done on copper cathode with stainless steel and lead anodes with a maximum recovery efficiency of 89.6%. For extraction and recovery of gold and silver, various techniques used in mineral processing were applied in this research. Thiosulfate leaching was chosen for gold extraction due to its proven environment friendly properties. Maximum gold extraction efficiency of 74.3% has been achieved in this work. To recover gold from pregnant solution, zinc cementation approach was used. Up to 85.9% gold was recovered with zinc cementation. Success of thiosulfate leaching and cementation confirms the validity of mineral
processing techniques in metal recovery from electronic waste. Research in this study can serve as a backbone for potential environmentally sound technology towards efficient metal recovery from electronic waste for small and medium scale recyclers.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2edc7fc19c5d0222ee01bf/,222,https://engrxiv.org/azuq9/,10.31224/osf.io/azuq9,,2020-01-27T15:30:33.925953,2020-01-27T15:30:42.943084

zfrhq,"A thermodynamic transient cross-bridge model for prediction of contractility and remodelling of the ventricle","Cardiac hypertrophy is an adaption of the heart to a change in cardiovascular loading conditions. The current understanding is that progression may be stress or strain driven, but the multi-scale nature of the cellular remodelling processes have yet to be uncovered. In this study, we develop a model of the contractile left ventricle, with the active cell tension described by a thermodynamically motivated cross-bridge cycling model. Simulation of the transient recruitment of myosin results in correct patterns of ventricular pressure predicted over a cardiac cycle. We investigate how changes in tissue loading and associated deviations in transient force generation can drive restructuring of cellular myofibrils in the heart wall. Our thermodynamic framework predicts in-series sarcomere addition (eccentric remodelling) in response to volume overload, and sarcomere addition in parallel (concentric remodelling) in response to valve and signalling disfunction. This framework provides a significant advance in the current understanding of the fundamental sub-sarcomere level biomechanisms underlying cardiac remodelling. Simulations reveal that pathological tissue loading conditions can significantly alter actin-myosin cross-bridge cycling over the course of the cardiac cycle. The resultant variation in sarcomere stress pushes an imbalance between the internal free energy of the myofibril and that of unbound contractile proteins, initiating remodelling. The link between cross-bridge thermodynamics and myofibril remodelling proposed in this study may significantly advance current understanding of cardiac disease onset.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2c66af87a1d901501cd5fc/,165,https://engrxiv.org/zfrhq/,10.31224/osf.io/zfrhq,,2020-01-26T09:57:45.977250,2020-01-26T09:58:01.512232
7mut6,"Accurate Heuristic Terrain Prediction in Powered Lower-Limb Prostheses Using Onboard Sensors","This study describes the development and offline validation of a heuristic algorithm for accurate prediction of ground terrain in a lower limb prosthesis. This method is based on inference of the ground terrain geometry using estimation of prosthetic limb kinematics during gait with a single integrated inertial measurement unit. We asked five subjects with below-knee amputations to traverse level ground, stairs, and ramps using a high-range-of-motion powered prosthesis while internal sensor data were remotely logged. We used these data to develop two terrain prediction algorithms. The first employed a state-of-the-art machine learning approach, while the second was a directly tuned heuristic using thresholds on estimated prosthetic ankle joint translations and ground slope. We compared the performance of these algorithms using resubstitution error for the machine learning algorithm and overall error for the heuristic algorithm.  Our optimal machine learning algorithm attained a resubstitution error of $3.4\%$ using 45 features, while our heuristic method attained an overall prediction error of $2.8\%$ using only 5 features derived from estimation of ground slope and horizontal and vertical ankle joint displacement. Compared with pattern recognition, the heuristic performed better on each individual subject, and across both level and non-level strides. These results demonstrate a method for heuristic prediction of ground terrain in a powered prosthesis. The method is more accurate, more interpretable, and less computationally expensive than state-of-the-art machine learning methods, and relies only on integrated prosthesis sensors. Finally, the method provides intuitively tunable thresholds to improve performance for specific walking conditions.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2c433887a1d9013e1d6374/,165,https://engrxiv.org/7mut6/,10.31224/osf.io/7mut6,,2020-01-25T14:38:36.848194,2020-01-25T18:19:12.021423

smrac,"Bitstream Photon Counting Chirped AM Lidar with a Dual Unipolar Signal","This paper is a follow-up to three previous papers: the first introducing the new Bitstream Photon Counting Chirped Amplitude Modulation (AM) Lidar (PC-CAML) with the unipolar Digital Logic Local Oscillator (DLLO) concept, the second introducing the improvement thereof using the bipolar DLLO, and the third introducing the improvement of digital In-phase and Quadrature-phase (I/Q) demodulation.
In that previous work, the signal was a single unipolar chirped sinusoidal or square wave. This paper introduces a new bitstream PC-CAML transceiver architecture that combines two unipolar chirped signals, referred to as the dual unipolar signal, to form a single bipolar signal in the receiver. (patent pending) This bipolar signal is mixed with the bipolar DLLOs in the in-phase (I) digital mixing and quadrature-phase (Q) digital mixing channels for digital I/Q demodulation for improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to that when using a single unipolar signal.
The simulation results presented in this paper indicate an SNR improvement for the dual unipolar chirped sinusoidal signal bitstream PC-CAML compared to that of the unipolar chirped sinusoidal signal bitstream PC-CAML (both with bipolar DLLOs and digital I/Q demodulation) of from about 3 dB to about 6 dB for signals below the onset of receiver saturation, and an improvement for maximum achievable SNR of about 13 dB if the receiver is allowed to saturate.
The bitstream PC-CAML with a dual unipolar signal and bipolar DLLOs with digital I/Q demodulation architecture discussed in this paper adds complexity to the transmitter and receiver compared to the architectures presented in the previous papers. Whether or not this additional complexity is worth the improved SNR will have to be decided as part of system trade studies for particular systems and their applications.
However, the new architecture still retains the key advantages of the previous bitstream PC-CAML  architectures since it still replaces bulky, power-hungry, and expensive wideband RF analog electronics in the receiver with digital components that can be implemented in inexpensive silicon complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) read-out integrated circuits (ROICs) to make the bitstream PC-CAML with a DLLO more suitable for compact lidar-on-a-chip systems and lidar array receivers than previous standard PC-CAML systems.

and multidimensional, making experimental and/or numerical
exploration of the synthesis prohibitive. We propose a more
practical approach to explore the synthesis-process relationships
of CNT forests using machine learning (ML) algorithms to
infer the underlying complex physical processes. Currently, no
such ML model linking CNT forest morphology to synthesis
parameters has been demonstrated. In the current work, we
use a physics-based numerical model to generate CNT forest
morphology images with known synthesis parameters to train
such a ML algorithm. The CNT forest synthesis variables
of CNT diameter and CNT number densities are varied to
generate a total of 12 distinct CNT forest classes. Images of the
resultant CNT forests at different time steps during the growth
and self-assembly process are then used as the training dataset.
Based on the CNT forest structural morphology, multiple
single and combined histogram-based texture descriptors are
used as features to build a random forest (RF) classifier to
predict class labels based on correlation of CNT forest physical
attributes with the growth parameters. The machine learning
model achieved an accuracy of up to 83.5% on predicting the
synthesis conditions of CNT number density and diameter.
These results are the first step towards rapidly characterizing
CNT forest attributes using machine learning. Identifying the

This has played an important role on shaking duration and intensity in past earthquakes such as the $M_w$ 8.0 1985 Micho\'acan, Mexico, $M_w$ 6.9 1995 Kobe, Japan, and $M_w$ 7.8 2015 Gorkha, Nepal. Although the phenomenon has been understood and addressed in the literature, it has not been fully incorporated in seismic hazard analysis, and Ground Motion Prediction Equations (GMPE). In this study, we perform an extensive parametric study on the characteristics of surface ground motion associated with basin effects using finite element simulations. We use an elastic medium subjected to vertically propagating SV plane waves and utilize idealized basin shapes to examine the effects of basin geometry and material properties. We specifically study the effects of four dimensionless parameters, the width-to-depth (aspect) ratio, the rock-to-soil material contrast, a dimensionless frequency that quantifies the depth of the basin relative to the dominant incident wavelength, and a dimensionless distance quantifying distance of the basin edges relative to the dominant wavelength. Our results show that basin effects can be reasonably characterized using at least three independent parameters, each of which can significantly alter the resultant ground motion. To demonstrate the application of dimensional analysis applied here, we investigate the response of the Kathmandu Valley during the 2015 $M_w$ 7.8  Gorkha Earthquake in Nepal using an idealized basin geometry and soil properties. Our results show that a simplified model can capture notable characteristics of the ground motion associated with basin effects which suggests that such studies can provide useful insights, relevant to the parameterization of basin effects in GMPEs and design code provisions.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e260712edceab019882df90/,404,https://engrxiv.org/mcnj5/,10.31224/osf.io/mcnj5,,2020-01-21T08:37:37.054056,2020-02-10T21:42:29.438859

v28bd,"Multi-Objective Optimization of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell/GT Combined Heat and Power System: A comparison between Particle Swarm and Genetic Algorithms","Many studies have attempted to optimize integrated Solid Oxide Fuel Cell-Gas Turbine (SOFC-GT), although different and somehow conflicting results are reported employing various algorithms. In this study, Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) is employed to approach the optimal design of SOFC-GT considering all prevailing factors. The emphasis is placed on the evaluation of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) performance as two effective approaches for solving the multi-objective and non-linear optimization problems. Multi- objective optimization is carried out on two vital objectives; the electrical efficiency and the overall output power of the system. The considerable achievements are the set of optimal points that aim to identify the system optimal performance which provides a practical basis for the decision-makers to choose the appropriate target functions. For the studied conditions, the two algorithms nearly exhibit similar performance, while the PSO is faster and more efficient in terms of computational effort. The PSO appears to achieve its ultimate parameter values in fewer generations compared to the GA algorithm under the examined circumstances. It is found that the maximum power of 410 kW is accomplished employing the GA optimization method with an efficiency of 64%, while PSO method yields the maximum power of 419.19 kW at the efficiency of 58.9%.

m4tqn,"Multimodal imaging of cerebral microhemorrhages and white matter degradation in geriatric patients with mild traumatic brain injury","Traditionally, neurobiologists have utilized microscale techniques of scientific investigation to uncover the fundamental organization and function of brain cells and neuronal ensembles. In recent decades, however, macroscale brain imaging methods like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) have facilitated a wider scope of understanding neural structure and function across the lifespan. Thanks to such methods, a broader picture of the relationship between microscale processes—studied by neurobiologists—and macroscale observations—made by clinicians—has emerged. More recently, the vascular component of neurodegeneration has come under renewed scrutiny partly due to increased appreciation of the relationship between neurovascular injury, cardiovascular disease and senescence. Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are among the smallest lesions of the cerebrum which can be visualized using MRI to indicate blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment; as such, this class of hemorrhages are important for the evaluation and macroscale detection of geriatric patients’ microscale pathologies associated with neurovascular disease and/or neurodegeneration. This chapter details a streamlined protocol for MRI/CT multimodal imaging data acquisition, archiving and digital processing, including methods tailored for the analysis of susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) scans to reveal CMB-related alterations of the human connectome.

Agreed, bitcoin launched in 2011 was the first large scale implementation of blockchain technology.  Also, Bitcoin’s success has triggered the establishment of nearly 1000 new cryptocurrencies.  This again lead to the delusion that the only application of blockchain technology is for the creation of cryptocurrency.  However, the blockchain technology is capable of a lot more than just cryptocurrency creation and may support such things as transactions that require personal identification, peer review, elections and other types of democratic decision-making and audit trails.  Blockchain exists with real world implementations beyond cryptocurrencies and these solutions deliver powerful benefits to healthcare organizations, bankers, retailers and consumers among others.  One of the areas where blockchain technology can be used effectively is healthcare industry.  Proper application of this technology in healthcare will not only save billions of money but also will contribute to the growth in research.

The TI mechanism consisting of a tuning spring, a rotational inertial mass, and a viscous damping component is able to increase energy absorption capability by taking advantage of the resonance effect of the rotational mass. This mechanism has been recently introduced for civil structures subjected to external loadings such as earthquakes and winds to decay vibration response immediately. The authors applied this mechanism to oscillating-body WECs and showed that the proposed WEC increased the power generation performance and broadened the effective frequency range without increasing the mass of the buoy itself through numerical simulation studies. To verify the validity of the proposed WEC experimentally, a small-scale prototype of the proposed device is designed and wave flume testing is carried out with various regular wave inputs of different frequencies. The results show that the WEC with the properly adjusted TI mechanism demonstrates better power generation performance compared to the conventional WEC over a wide range of wave frequencies.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e1a63d46822bd0046ff1936/,234,https://engrxiv.org/wjgv9/,10.31224/osf.io/wjgv9,10.1016/j.apor.2020.102127,2020-01-12T09:50:48.842680,2020-03-23T11:23:52.691547

The system is based on a smart control unit and lighting control devices that can be directly mounted on the lamps in series connection. The installation is noninvasive and does not require any changes in the wiring system, since the communication between each lamp and the control system is realized by means of a 2.4 GHz wireless protocol. The system functionality is ensured with any lamps, also with non-dimmable ones. Tests and functionality verifications on the system were performed in laboratory, proving the applicability to real cases and performances that are comparable to the ones achievable with dimmable LED lamps, but with a significant cost saving.
Hypothesizing the application of the proposed system and of different control technologies and strategies to a real academic classroom case study, different lighting scenarios have been simulated. Obtained results allow quantifying the effects in terms of energy consumption and CO2 emissions relative to such scenarios, achieving up to 69.6% of energy saving and 30.5% of CO2 emissions avoided.

Further, the deposition of metal created extraordinary contact through ZnO-NR utilizing a rapid thermal process (RTP) allowing the interaction of plasmon-coupled nature and surface energy transfer from the donor (R6 G) to the acceptor (ZnO). The percentage of energy transfer efficiency continuously decreased with the increment of GNPs size, shown by 72.93, 67.52 and 47.86%, corresponding to the increase of the distance between the donor and acceptor of 63.03, 67.25, and 82.49 Å, respectively. In other words, the efficiency of PC-SET complied the 1/d4 distance dependence model between donor and acceptor molecules with the detection of long-distance ranges from 46.95 – 120 Å.

Given such difficulties, there are a few interdisciplinary methodologies, capable of carrying out multi-objective analyses for this kind of buildings, and they are often based on in-situ monitoring that, however, may not be able to predict the effects deriving from different conceivable technologies and control strategies. In this work, an interdisciplinary methodology is employed for evaluating cultural heritage conservation conditions, occupants ‘thermal comfort and energy performance of a specific historic building category, such as churches, on the basis of experimental and numerical approach. The methodology was applied to the case study of an ancient Italian church, recently restored following the earthquake that hit L’Aquila in 2009. After the refurbishment of the church, the statistical analysis of temperature and relative humidity experimental data allowed to observe that the conservation conditions of artistic heritage just restored may be non-correct, due to remarkable thermo-hygrometric fluctuations of the indoor microclimate. Therefore, starting from the current condition of absence of HVAC system, calibrated dynamic simulation models of the church allowed to hypothesize different technological solutions able to control the indoor microclimate and to evaluate the effects on artworks preservation, thermal comfort, and energy performance. The results of the multi-scenario analysis showed that suitable conservation conditions (PIs &gt; 90%) and thermal comfort can be obtained by employing a complex heating/cooling and humidification/dehumidification system which determines a significant increase in energy consumption.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e1709d675458402ddf9f91c/,220,https://engrxiv.org/a9dg5/,10.31224/osf.io/a9dg5,10.1016/j.culher.2019.11.008,2020-01-09T18:15:38.991349,2020-01-09T18:16:03.712163
q9k5h,"Enhanced power absorption of a point absorber wave energy converter using a tuned inertial mass","A novel point absorber wave energy converter with a tuned inertial mass (TIM), which is capable of significantly increasing the energy absorption and broadening the effective bandwidth, is proposed in this paper. The mechanism of the TIM has originally been introduced in the field of civil engineering as a passive energy absorber for structures subjected to external loadings such as earthquakes. It relies on attaching an additional tuning spring and a rotational inertial mass to the primary system, to improve the energy absorption performance by amplifying the displacement of the damper. Thus, considering typical point absorbers modeled as a mass-spring-dashpot system similar way to civil structures, the application of the TIM to wave energy converters can be expected to have a significant effect. 
In this paper, numerical investigation on the power generation performance of a point absorber with the TIM is conducted under random sea waves. 
The amplitude response and power generation performance are compared with the conventional point absorber, considering both non-resonant and resonant buoy cases.

In that previous work, there was only a single channel of digital mixing of the DLLO with the received photon counting signal. This paper introduces a new bitstream PC-CAML receiver architecture with an in-phase (I) digital mixing channel and a quadrature phase (Q) digital mixing channel for digital I/Q demodulation with the bipolar DLLO to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by 3 dB compared to that for the single digital mixing channel with the bipolar DLLO and by 5.5 dB compared to that for the single digital mixing channel with the unipolar DLLO.

In particular, water and gas consumption are highly interrelated with one another (often because gas is used for water heating). Furthermore, electricity consumption is affected by building type, and electricity and water consumption are particularly interrelated in nonresidential buildings.

vw3dh,"A Novel Traction Mechanism Based on Retractable Crampons to Minimize Soil Compaction and Reduce Energy Consumption","Tired and tracked tractors on agricultural soil have the inherent limitation of needing considerable ballast to gain traction and have low tractive efficiency due to slip and tire flexing. These limitations contribute to soil degradation and reduce the possibility to intensify mechanical field management. To address these disadvantages, we introduce a novel traction mechanism which combines inching or push-pull locomotion with retractable tines or crampons which penetrate the soil every few meters. Once inserted into the soil, relatively thin and short crampons provide sufficient motion resistance to pull tillage implements through the soil, with no need for additional ballast. 
Optimal crampon design depends on the width, depth in the soil, rake angle, and inter-crampon spacing. A hinged design allows for reliable crampon insertion and extraction. The pull/weight ratio of the vehicle can be controlled by placing the hinge low and by separating the crampon from the hinge by an arm. Travel reduction and tractive efficiency can be controlled through the actuation length of the push-pull mechanism. Experimental results show that crampons can achieve a high pull/weight ratio, travel reduction of less than 10%, and a tractive efficiency of over 90% on agricultural soil.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e0c0b19fbb1ef0065d7a89b/,165,https://engrxiv.org/vw3dh/,10.31224/osf.io/vw3dh,,2020-01-01T15:45:37.701357,2020-01-26T10:04:26.483084

The resulting soil degradation and energy cost are limiting factors that hinder the intensification of mechanical field management. The interlock drive system overcomes these limitations through the use of articulated spikes which temporarily interlock with the soil to generate traction. Once inserted into the soil, relatively thin and short spikes provide sufficient motion resistance to pull implements through the soil, with no need for additional ballast. 
To better understand the interaction of a spike with the soil, we conducted a series of experiments where we controlled the draft force and measured the resulting motion of the spike as it penetrates the soil and interlocks with it. Results show that the interlock drive system can generate pull reliably even on wet soil, and that a pull/weight ratio of 2 and higher is possible. The tractive efficiency for a vehicle using the interlock drive system can reach a ratio as high as 0.96 for wet and 0.975 for dry soil, as calculated from the experimental results. Precise soil applications would benefit from further improvement in the horizontal precision of soil penetration.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e0c013edf02d2005ada8286/,153,https://engrxiv.org/mh93n/,10.31224/osf.io/mh93n,,2020-01-01T15:44:29.496490,2020-01-26T10:04:13.908602

These limitations contribute to soil compaction, make the agricultural tractor energy-inefficient and make it unviable to power a tractor with solar panels or by storing renewable energy in batteries.
To address these disadvantages as a whole, we introduce a novel traction mechanism that allows weeding and cultivation using only autarkic solar energy, based on the novel principle of retractable tines or crampons for traction. The mechanism inserts relatively small crampons every few meters into the soil, and then uses a push-pull mechanism to pull tillage implements through the soil, without any additional ballast. The light weight of the resulting machine and the small contact area of crampons with the soil reduce soil compaction, while the static nature of the crampons minimizes energy loss and increases energy efficiency.

UTOPUS traction technology offers a new method of locomotion which abandons the wheel paradigm for a two-phased anchoring and de-anchoring technique by driving removable crampons into the ground. In agriculture it minimizes soil compaction, reduces energy consumption, and produces a draft force similar to much heavier wheel-based tractors.
Here we investigate whether the inherent stability of locomotion based on removable crampons allows exploration of steep and difficult terrain. We present experimental results from climbing and descending a mound of heterogeneous dust, sand, and granular material at the critical angle of repose, at an inclination of 25–40 degrees. The UTOPUS vehicle repeatedly climbed and descended the mound safely. An initial problem when reaching the top of the mound was solved by rebalancing the vehicle. Occasional failure occurred when the vehicle had strong lateral inclination, or on patches of very loose ground, suggesting the need for some design changes to the current model.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e0be429fbb1ef006ad71e3c/,166,https://engrxiv.org/bgznf/,10.31224/osf.io/bgznf,,2020-01-01T15:42:08.320524,2020-01-26T10:01:23.446416
83794,"Motion Study of Spike Entering the Soil of the Interlock Drive System","Machines for intensive agriculture require drive power. Until now this has been generated mainly by frictional connection to the soil. A frictional connection needs weight to apply drive power. This weight shears and compacts the soil, reduces soil fertility, reduces water infiltration, increases water runoff and increases erosion. The generation of traction on a field is also possible via the interlock drive system, where narrow articulated spikes penetrate the ground at regular intervals and push the vehicle horizontally over the ground, avoiding the vertical pressure of wheels. 
The interlock drive system can provide high tractive power for productive agriculture using lightweight construction and little energy consumption, as has been demonstrated in over 30 prototypes. Many of the fundamental working principles of this new drive system are not yet properly described. This makes it difficult to design a machine for specific soil and operating conditions without adjustment and refitting in the field. So, it is unclear until now whether an implementation with a few long spikes will operate more efficiently than an implementation with more but shorter spikes. It has also not been examined how the degree of compaction and the amount of soil moisture affect the efficiency of the spike and how the horizontal motion of a spike depends on soil conditions.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e0be28ddf02d20065d961ed/,147,https://engrxiv.org/83794/,10.31224/osf.io/83794,,2020-01-01T15:41:06.200179,2020-01-26T10:03:11.405049
ezhrp,"Integrated Sensing and Earthmoving Vehicle for Lunar Landing Pad Construction","Reducing the forces necessary to construct projects like landing pads and blast walls is possibly one of the major drivers in reducing the costs of establishing lunar settlements. The interlock drive system generates traction by penetrating articulated spikes into the ground and by using the natural strength of the ground for traction. The spikes develop a high pull to weight ratio and promise good mobility in soft, rocky and steep terrain, energy-efficient operation, and their design is relatively simple. By penetrating the ground at regular intervals, the spikes also enable the in-situ measurement of a variety of ground properties, including penetration resistance, temperature, and pH. Here we present a concept for a light lunar bulldozer with interlocking spikes that uses a blade and a ripper to loosen and move soil over short distances, that maps ground properties in situ and that uses this information to construct landing pads and blast walls, and to otherwise interact with the ground in a targeted and efficient manner. Trials on Mediterranean soil have shown that this concept promises to satisfy many of the basic requirements expected of a lunar excavator. To better predict performance in a lunar or Martian environment, experiments on relevant soil simulants are needed.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e0baa9ffbb1ef005ad77599/,234,https://engrxiv.org/ezhrp/,10.31224/osf.io/ezhrp,,2019-12-31T20:17:25.403033,2020-01-09T15:53:55.803600

Liu et al., have shown that the Multi-Task Deep NeuralNetwork, due to the regularization effect produced when training as a result of it’s cross task data, ismore robust than a vanilla BERT model trained only on one task (1.1%-1.5% absolute difference).I then show that although the MT-DNN has generalized better, making it easily transferable acrossdomains and tasks, it can still be compromised as after only 2 attacks (1-character and 2-character)the accuracy drops by 42.05% and 32.24% for the SNLI and SciTail tasks.

In that previous work, the DLLO was unipolar. In this paper, a new bipolar DLLO for the bitstream PC-CAML is introduced (patent pending). 

The bipolar DLLO retains the key advantages of the unipolar DLLO for the bitstream PC-CAML since it also replaces bulky, power-hungry, and expensive wideband RF analog electronics with digital components that can be implemented in inexpensive silicon complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) read-out integrated circuits (ROICs) to make the bitstream PC-CAML with a DLLO more suitable for compact lidar-on-a-chip systems and lidar array receivers than previous PC-CAML systems. 

In addition, the bipolar DLLO improves the electrical power signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the bitstream PC-CAML by about 2.5 dB compared to that of the unipolar DLLO as shown by the theoretical and Monte Carlo simulation results presented in this paper. Theoretically, there should be a 3 dB improvement for the bipolar DLLO from the elimination of the signal power loss to the DC component of the intermediate frequency (IF) spectrum that occurs with the unipolar DLLO. However, this improvement is partially offset by a higher quantization noise for the bipolar DLLO compared to that of the unipolar DLLO as explained in this paper.

This paper introduces the bipolar DLLO for bitstream PC-CAML concept and presents the initial signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) theory with comparisons to Monte Carlo simulation results.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e0646721a65e9002571a7a9/,146,https://engrxiv.org/7mcbg/,10.31224/osf.io/7mcbg,,2019-12-27T21:10:51.532155,2019-12-27T22:05:00.750647

x8g4r,"Benchmarking soft-sensors for remote monitoring of on-site wastewater treatment plants","On-site wastewater treatment plants are usually unattended, so undetected failures often lead to prolonged periods of reduced performance. To stabilize the good performance of unattended plants, soft-sensors could expose faults and failures to the operator. In a previous study, we developed soft-sensors and showed that soft-sensors with data from unmaintained physical sensors can be as accurate as soft-sensors with data from maintained ones. The quantities sensed were pH and dissolved oxygen (DO), and soft-sensors were used to predict nitrification performance. In the present study, we use synthetic data and monitor three plants to test these soft-sensors. We find that a long sludge age and a moderate aeration rate improve the pH soft-sensor accuracy, and that the aeration regime is the main operational parameter affecting the accuracy of the DO soft-sensor. We demonstrate that integrated design, monitoring, and control are necessary to achieve robust accuracy and to obviate case-specific fine-tuning. Additionally, we provide a unique labelled dataset for further feature and data-driven soft-sensor development. Our approach is limited to sequencing batch reactors. Moreover, nitrite accumulation and alkalinity limitation cannot be detected. The strength of the approach is that unmaintained sensors drastically reduce monitoring costs, enabling the monitoring of plants hitherto unchecked.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dfb32780236b8000c742cd3/,341,https://engrxiv.org/x8g4r/,10.31224/osf.io/x8g4r,,2019-12-19T12:51:43.554759,2020-07-13T08:27:28.087097
4heu5,"Prediction model of chloride diffusion in concrete considering the coupling effects of coarse aggregate and steel reinforcement exposed to marine tidal environment","Chloride-induced corrosion of steel reinforcement is one of the significant factors for the durability of the
reinforced concrete structures exposed to marine environments. Reinforced concrete is a multiphase
composite material composed of mortar, coarse aggregate, and rebar. The coarse aggregate and rebar
can both affect the chloride diffusion characteristics of concrete. Nevertheless, the current researches
related to the effects of the aforementioned two impact factors on chloride diffusion in concrete either
considered the coarse aggregate only, or taken into account the steel bar separately. The coupling effects
of coarse aggregate and steel reinforcement on chloride transport in concrete required to be further
explored and discussed. In this paper, an in-door physical experiment for chloride diffusion in plain
and reinforced concrete specimens exposed to marine tidal environment was carried out. The specimens
were cast using different volume fractions of coarse aggregate and diameters of steel reinforcement. The
chloride concentrations for experimental specimens were measured at various exposure times, and these
measurements were adopted to further investigate the common influences of coarse aggregate volume
fraction and blocking effect of rebar on chloride diffusion in concrete. Using the impact factors of coarse
aggregate volume fraction f(v), the direct and indirect blocking effect coefficients of rebar a(v), br(U/c) to
improve the analytical solution of Fick’s second law, a prediction model of chloride diffusion in concrete
considering the coupling effects of coarse aggregate and steel reinforcement was proposed. The accuracy
of this proposed prediction model was validated by comparing the chloride concentrations evaluated by
the prediction model with the experimental measurements. The findings are expected to be useful in
realistically predicting the durability of reinforced concrete structures.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dfad6a20236b8000b735781/,662,https://engrxiv.org/4heu5/,10.31224/osf.io/4heu5,10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.04.221,2019-12-19T12:49:45.997303,2019-12-19T12:50:01.644377

However, the study of the travel behavior at the individual level and the relation between social media activity and the activity/mobility patterns of users has received limited attention. To rectify this, this study examines Twitter data for unveiling the relations between geo-tagged Tweets and Twitter user sentiments, and the respective activity types performed in the real-world. In this work we try to find common patterns between users' Twitter activity and their actual mobility/activity patterns with the aim to provide some generalizations that can help to understand and model the travel behavior of users. This is achieved with the development of educated rules and probabilistic models that can predict the mobility transfers of users between different activities based solely on social media data. The validity of our generalizations is validated with the use of 4-month Twitter data from London. Only active Twitter users have been selected to study in deep the relations between social media activities/sentiments and the activity types performed in the real-world. Although our generalizations are case study-specific, they demonstrate that it is possible to extract the activity and mobility behavior of users with the use of social media and offer a first step in this direction.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dfa04d53f4712000a772d29/,257,https://engrxiv.org/7d8kf/,10.31224/osf.io/7d8kf,,2019-12-18T16:51:21.331814,2019-12-18T16:51:43.163267

The periodic void shapes are modeled using three and four point hypotrochoid curves with a single shape parameter that controls the sharpness of the points. Using the complex variable method of elasticity, we derive the in-plane elastic constants (Exx, Eyy, Gxy, nuxy) as well as out-of-plane antiplane shear constants (Gzx and Gzy). The remaining out-of-plane elastic constants (Ezz, nuzx, nuzy) are derived by directly solving the linearelasticity equations. We compare our results by conducting unit cell simulations on both mesostructures and at various porosity values. The simulations match the closed-form expressions exactly for Ezz, nuzx, and nuzy. For the remaining elastic constants, the simulation results match the closed-form expressions better for the square mesostructure than the hexagonal mesostructure. Differences between simulation and closed-form expressions are less than 10% for porosity values less than 6% (hexagonal mesostructure) and 10% (square mesostructure) for any of the nine elastic constants.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5df97659bf8a43000a8b29ba/,261,https://engrxiv.org/c3tzk/,10.31224/osf.io/c3tzk,,2019-12-18T16:50:10.641563,2019-12-18T16:50:24.204853

v8x52,"COMPUTATIONAL EVALUATION OF THERMAL BARRIER COATINGS","In the power plant industry, the turbine inlet temperature (TIT) plays a key role in the efficiency of the gas turbine and, therefore, the overall—in most cases combined—thermal power cycle efficiency. Gas turbine efficiency increases by increasing TIT. However, an increase of TIT would increase the turbine component temperature which can be critical (e.g., hot gas attack). Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs)—porous media coatings—can avoid this case and protect the surface of the turbine blade. This combination of TBC and film cooling produces a better cooling performance than conventional cooling processes. The effective thermal conductivity of this composite is highly important in the design and other thermal/structural assessments. In this article, the effective thermal conductivity of a simplified model of TBC is evaluated. This work details a numerical study on the steady-state thermal response of two-phase porous media in two dimensions using personal finite element analysis (FEA) code. Specifically, the system response quantity (SRQ) under investigation is the dimensionless effective thermal conductivity of the domain. A thermally conductive matrix domain is modeled with a thermally conductive circular pore arranged in a uniform packing configuration. Both the pore size and the pore thermal conductivity are varied over a range of values to investigate the relative effects on the SRQ. In this investigation, an emphasis is placed on using code and solution verification techniques to evaluate the obtained results. The method of manufactured solutions (MMS) was used to perform code verification for the study, showing the FEA code to be second-order accurate. Solution verification was performed using the grid convergence index (GCI) approach with the global deviation uncertainty estimator on a series of five systematically refined meshes for each porosity and thermal conductivity model configuration. A comparison of the SRQs across all domain configurations is made, including uncertainty derived through the GCI analysis.

Several photovoltaic (PV) technologies exist, which cause various pathways to produce electricity from solar energy. This paper evaluates the competition between three influential solar technologies based on photovoltaic technique to find the optimal pathways for satisfying the electricity demand: (1) multicrystalline silicon; (2) copper, indium, gallium, and selenium (CIGS); and (3) multijunction. Besides the technical factors, there are other effective parameters such as cost, operability, feasibility, and capacity that should be considered when assessing the different pathways as optimal and viable long-term alternatives. To aid this decision-making process, a generic optimization-based model was developed for the longrange energy planning and design of future electricity supply system from solar energy. By applying dynamic programming techniques, the model is capable of identifying the optimal investment strategies and integrated supply system configurations from the many alternatives.

agcyk,"Implementing Natural Gas in a Compression Ignition Cycle Using Noble Gas Addition","Natural gas is known as a relatively clean fossil fuel due to its low carbon to hydrogen ratio compared to other transportation fuels, which yields a reduction of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and unburned hydrocarbons emissions. However, it has a low cetane number, which makes it a difficult fuel for use in compression ignition engines. A potential solution for this issue can be adding small amounts of argon, as a noble gas with a low specific heat to modify the intake conditions. In this numerical study, a commercial compression ignition engine has been modeled to evaluate the auto-ignition of natural gas with the modified intake conditions. Different amounts of argon added to the intake air are examined in order to attain the optimal operating conditions. A detailed chemistry solver is implemented on a 53-species chemical kinetics mechanism to calculate the rate constants. The results show that compression ignition of natural gas can be achieved by adding small amounts of argon to the intake air.

Moreover, it leads to the reduction in ignition delay and heat release rate, and expands the combustion duration.

5kgx2,"Screening Compounds for Fast Pyrolysis and Catalytic Biofuel Upgrading Using Artificial Neural Networks","There is significant interest among researchers in finding economically sustainable alternatives to fossil-derived drop-in fuels and fuel additives. Fast pyrolysis, a method for converting biomass into liquid hydrocarbons with the potential for use as fuels or fuel additives, is a promising technology that can be two to three times less expensive at scale when compared to alternative approaches such as gasification and fermentation. However, many bio-oils directly derived from fast pyrolysis have a high oxygen content and high acidity, indicating poor performance in diesel engines when used as fuels or fuel additives. Thus, a combination of selective fast pyrolysis and chemical catalysis could produce tuned bioblendstocks that perform optimally in diesel engines. The variance in performance for derived compounds introduces a feedback loop in researching acceptable fuels and fuel additives, as various combustion properties for these compounds must be determined after pyrolysis and catalytic upgrading occurs. The present work aims to reduce this feedback loop by utilizing artificial neural networks trained with quantitative structure-property relationship values to preemptively screen pure component compounds that will be produced from fast pyrolysis and catalytic upgrading. The quantitative structure-property relationship values selected as inputs for models are discussed, the cetane number and sooting propensity of compounds derived from the catalytic upgrading of phenol are predicted, and the viability of these compounds as fuels and fuel additives is analyzed. The model constructed to predict cetane number has a test set prediction root-mean-squared error of 9.874 cetane units, and the model constructed to predict yield sooting index has a test set prediction root-mean-squared error of 13.478 yield sooting index units (on the unified scale).",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5df27d55f7ca8e000a984e78/,187,https://engrxiv.org/5kgx2/,10.31224/osf.io/5kgx2,10.1115/ICEF2019-7170,2019-12-12T20:05:58.634051,2019-12-12T20:06:20.994150
n3muw,"Effect of Hydrogen and Carbon Monoxide Addition to Methane on Laminar Burning Velocity","Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) in spark-ignited engines is a key technique to reduce in-cylinder NOx production by decreasing the combustion temperature. The major species of the exhaust gas in rich combustion of natural gas are hydrogen and carbon monoxide, which can subsequently be recirculated to the cylinders using EGR. In this study, the effect of hydrogen and carbon monoxide addition to methane on laminar burning velocity and flame morphological structure is investigated. Due to the broad flammability limit and high burning velocity of hydrogen compared to methane, this addition to the gaseous mixture leads to an increase in burning velocity, less emissions production, and a boost to the thermal efficiency of internal combustion engines. Premixed CH4-H2-CO-Air flames are experimentally investigated using an optically accessible constant volume combustion chamber (CVCC) accompanied with a high-speed Z-type Schlieren imaging system. Furthermore, a numerical code is applied to quantify the laminar burning velocity based on the pressure rise during flame propagation within the CVCC. According to the empirical and numerical results, the addition of hydrogen and carbon monoxide enhances laminar burning velocity while influencing the flame structure and development.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5df27b389a7ce3000a5f8d74/,202,https://engrxiv.org/n3muw/,10.31224/osf.io/n3muw,10.1115/ICEF2019-7169,2019-12-12T20:05:01.169440,2019-12-12T20:05:22.076640

The authors use stream flow observations with 15 minutes resolution from the year 2008 to 2017 at 140 U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) streamflow gauges monitoring the streams and rivers over the State of Iowa. The spatial scale of the basins ranges from about 7 km2 to 37,000 km2. The study explores three approaches: simple persistence, gradient persistence and anomaly persistence. The study shows that persistence forecasts skill has strong dependence on basin scales and weaker but non-negligible dependence on geometric properties of the river network for a given basin. Among the three approaches explored, anomaly persistence shows highest skill especially for small basins, under about 500 km2. The anomaly persistence can serve as a benchmark for model evaluations considering the effect of basin scales and geometric properties of river network of the basin. This study further reiterates that persistence forecasts are hard-to-beat methods for larger basin scales at short to medium forecast range.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5deaaf3131d852000b03daf7/,233,https://engrxiv.org/jkbpq/,10.31224/osf.io/jkbpq,10.1111/1752-1688.12821,2019-12-06T20:37:53.567402,2019-12-06T20:38:04.470367

rd7x6,"Streamflow Forecasting Without Models","The authors explore simple concepts of persistence in streamflow forecasting based on the real-time streamflow observations from the years 2002 to 2018 at 140 U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) streamflow gauges in Iowa.  The spatial scale of the basins ranges from about 7 km2 to 37,000 km2.  Motivated by the need for evaluating the skill of real-time streamflow forecasting systems, the authors perform quantitative skill assessment of different persistence schemes across spatial scales and lead-times.  They show that skill in temporal persistence forecasting has a strong dependence on basin size, and a weaker, but non-negligible, dependence on geometric properties of the river networks in the basins.  Building on results from this temporal persistence, they extend the streamflow persistence forecasting to space through flow-connected river networks.  The approach simply assumes that streamflow at a station in space will persist to another station which is flow-connected; these are referred to as pure spatial persistence forecasts (PSPF).  The authors show that skill of PSPF of streamflow is strongly dependent on the monitored vs. predicted basin area-ratio and lead-times, and weakly related to the downstream flow distance between stations.  River network topology shows some effect on the hydrograph timing and timing of the peaks, depending on the stream gauge configuration.  The study shows that the skill depicted in terms of Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) &gt; 0.5 can be achieved for basin area ratio &gt; 0.6 and lead-time up to three days.

Four upward-flow sulfate-reducing bioreactors each containing a 23 L mixture of organic waste materials and either waste mussel shells or limestone as an alkaline amendment were tested at hydraulic retentions of 3.3 and 10 days to treat acidic mine drainage (pH 2.9, 30 mg/L Fe, 16 mg/L Mn, 5 mg/L Zn) for ten months. A combination of methods was used to examine the effect of alkalinity source on the fate of these metals. Consistent with the monitoring data of the effluent that showed circumneutral pH and low metal concentrations, higher concentrations of Fe, Zn and Mn were found in the spent than the initial substrate, with greater metal and acidity removal in l reactors containing mussel shells (at similar residence times). Sequential extraction procedures found that Fe was mainly in the oxidizable and the residual fractions, Zn in the reducible and residual, and Mn in the exchangeable, reducible and acid extractable fractions. SEM analyses confirmed the presence of pyrite in the substrate, and the use of PHREEQC supported the interpretation that precipitation of iron sulfide and oxyhydroxide minerals, manganese carbonates and zinc sulfide occurred within the substrate for both alkalinity sources. Adsorption edge experiments on the initial substrates confirmed the potential for Zn and Mn to adsorb onto organic materials. Alkalinity source greatly affected system performance with the mussel shell reactors outperforming limestone on a volumetric basis, with the inner surfaces of the mussel shells appearing to be important for greater ongoing alkalinity release, and the outer shells important as metal sorption sites not available in limestone reactors.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5de57169ab905e000cf1afca/,106,https://engrxiv.org/yzh9s/,10.31224/osf.io/yzh9s,,2019-12-03T14:19:42.880543,2019-12-03T14:20:02.840541

agc43,"Cognitive Internet of Vehicles: Motivation, Layered Architecture and Security Issues","Over the past few years, we have experienced great technological advancements in the information and communication field, which has significantly contributed to reshaping the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) concept.  Evolving from the platform of a collection of sensors aiming to collect data, the data exchanged paradigm among vehicles is shifted from the local network to the cloud. With the introduction of cloud and edge computing along with ubiquitous 5G mobile network, it is expected to see the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in data processing and smart decision imminent. So as to fully understand the future automobile scenario in this verge of industrial revolution 4.0, it is necessary first of all to get a clear understanding of the cutting-edge technologies that going to take place in the automotive ecosystem so that the cyber-physical impact on transportation system can be measured. CIoV, which is abbreviated from Cognitive Internet of Vehicle, is one of the recently proposed architectures of the technological evolution in transportation, and it has amassed great attention.  It introduces cloud-based artificial intelligence and machine learning into transportation system. What are the future expectations of CIoV? To fully contemplate this architecture’s future potentials, and milestones set to achieve, it is crucial to understand all the technologies that leaned into it. Also, the security issues to meet the security requirements of its practical implementation. Aiming to that, this paper presents the evolution of CIoV along with the layer abstractions to outline the distinctive functional parts of the proposed architecture.

To investigate this question, this study derives cost functions for the selected pipeline reassignment methods. By applying geospatial hydrogen supply chain modeling, the technical and economic potential of natural gas pipeline reassignment during a hydrogen market introduction is assessed.
The results of this study show a technically viable potential of more than 80% of the analyzed representative German pipeline network. By comparing the derived pipeline cost functions it could be derived that pipeline reassignment can reduce the hydrogen transmission costs by more than 60%.

4ryu2,"Understanding the deformation gradient in Abaqus and key guidelines for anisotropic hyperelastic user material subroutines (UMATs)","This tutorial paper provides a step-by-step guide to developing a comprehensive understanding of the different forms of the deformation gradient used in Abaqus, and outlines a number of key issues that must be considered when developing an Abaqus user defined material subroutine (UMAT) in which the Cauchy stress is computed from the deformation gradient. Firstly, we examine the ""classical"" forms of global and local deformation gradients. We then show that Abaqus/Standard does not use the classical form of the local deformation gradient when continuum elements are used, and we highlight the important implications for UMAT development. We outline the key steps that must be implemented in developing an anisotropic fibre-reinforced hyperelastic UMAT for use with continuum elements and local orientation systems. We also demonstrate that a classical local deformation gradient is provided by Abaqus/Standard if structural (shell and membrane) elements are used, and by Abaqus/Explicit for all element types. We emphasise, however, that the majority of biomechanical simulations rely on the use of continuum elements with a local coordinate system in Abaqus/Standard, and therefore the development of a hyperelastic UMAT requires an in-depth and precise understanding of the form of the non-classical deformation gradient provided as input by Abaqus.  Several worked examples and case studies are provided for each section, so that the details and implications of the form of the deformation gradient can be fully understood. For each worked example in this tutorial paper the source files and code (Abaqus input files, UMATs, and Matlab script files) are provided, allowing the reader to efficiently explore the implications of the form of the deformation gradient in the development of a UMAT.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dd3c34382d216000c4f624c/,1411,https://engrxiv.org/4ryu2/,10.31224/osf.io/4ryu2,,2019-11-19T12:46:45.608810,2019-11-19T12:47:01.943136
ywbvg,"Linking the installation response of screw piles to soil strength and ultimate capacity","A perceived advantage of screw-type foundations is the ability infer aspects of foundation performance from quantities measured or observed during installation, especially the installation torque. A particular concept widely used in practice is to correlate installation torque to ultimate capacity. This notion has proven useful as a field verification technique despite the absence of validated models that relate key variables of interest, such as installation torque, axial (crowd) force, geometrical parameters, and soil strength. This paper considers previous work by the co-authors and collaborators on analytical, numerical, and physical modelling of screw piles to relate the quantities measured or controlled during installation (e.g., installation torque) to the ultimate capacity and soil strength. Attention is given to saturated clay as a particular soil type amenable to simplified analysis. An analytical model for a single-helix pile is considered as a means of directly relating the ultimate capacity and undrained shear strength to the installation torque, crowd force, plate pitch, plate diameter, shaft diameter, installation depth, and surface roughness. The connection between the installation variables and ultimate capacity—and the sensitivity to crowd force in particular, a quantity that is typically not measured during field installations—is also discussed. The theoretical predictions are compared against data obtained from small-scale laboratory experiments that suggest the installation torque relates to the remolded strength of the soil.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dd38f8c1d56d2000ede7ce9/,204,https://engrxiv.org/ywbvg/,10.31224/osf.io/ywbvg,,2019-11-19T12:45:32.457157,2019-11-19T12:46:01.346653

A biological method using hot water (HW) Clerodendrum splendens (C. splendens) leaf extract is adopted for the discussion. The RSM integrated central composite design (CCD) is used to derive a quadratic objective function to model the yield of AgNPs by accounting the effects of the processing parameters, namely, C. splendens concentration, pH, and the reaction time.

Existing regime diagrams are based on a small amount of data classified by superficial visual characteristics, making these diagrams too inaccurate to reliably determine the correct regime. A more accurate regime diagram is developed using a large compilation of breakup length data combined with theory where the data is sparse.

In this research, the impact of different parameters such as the effect of the eccentricity of loads or the change in the horizontal distance of the loading profiles in buckling of the composite columns with double IPE cross-sections as well as the impact of different value of slenderness on buckling of composite box columns has been investigated. Based on the results, the steel member's yielding will be delayed by filling the steel sections with concrete. Also, an increase in the amount of composite column capacity is directly related to the associative ratio of composite concrete. In other words, increasing the ratio of the concrete surface leads to greater capacity which is caused by being filled with concrete.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dd1f98a9a425200141413b1/,133,https://engrxiv.org/wqgj8/,10.31224/osf.io/wqgj8,,2019-11-18T14:11:09.462040,2019-11-18T14:12:07.336045
mkzp5,"A Stochastic Multiscale Peridynamic Model for Corrosion-induced Fracture in Reinforced Concrete","Concrete fracture caused by corrosion of reinforcing bars may cause subsequent structure failure. To better predict this process, we introduce a partially-homogenized stochastic peridynamic model with the simplest constitutive relation (linear elastic with brittle failure). The model links microscale information (phase volume fractions of mortar, aggregates, interfaces) to macroscale fracture behavior, while costing the same as a fully homogenized model. We show, and explain why a fully-homogenized peridynamic model fails to capture the correct concrete fracture modes/patterns, while the new model succeeds. The multiscale model predicts the evolution of fracture in reinforced concrete caused by corrosion products expansion in samples with a single or multiple rebars. Non-uniform expansion of corrosion products is enforced here as preset, incremental radial displacements. The computed fracture patterns and the order in which various cracks develop match what is seen in experiments.

k2dt5,"A Method for Superelastic Constitutive Properties Calibration Using Full-field Surface Strain Data","Superelastic Nitinol is a widely used material to manufacture implantable medical devices. Simulations are extensively used in the design, optimization, and durability assessment of Nitinol implants. The constitutive response of superelastic materials is non-linear, anisotropic, and asymmetric in tension vs. compression. The existing methods to determine the superelastic material properties used in finite element simulations typically do not account for some of these complexities. The goal of this work is to introduce a method to determine the superelastic material constitutive properties using full-field surface strain measurements. We propose using digital image correlation to obtain surface strain fields during tensile testing of specially designed diamond specimens. The material properties are determined by minimizing a difference metric defined in terms of the local strain difference and the global load difference between the experiment and trial simulations. We also propose a metric in terms of the local strain difference between experimental measurement and simulation prediction to report the credibility of the material properties fitted using this method. The philosophy behind this method and the proposed metric to quantify the accuracy of material property fitting reflects the growing consensus in the implantable device community that the simulation results must be accompanied by a quantification of their credibility.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dcc69851640ea000d960a39/,268,https://engrxiv.org/k2dt5/,10.31224/osf.io/k2dt5,,2019-11-13T22:08:38.694033,2019-11-13T22:09:11.436534

4j83z,"An experimental and computational investigation of the effects of volumetric boundary conditions on the compressive mechanics of passive skeletal muscle","Computational modeling, such as finite element analysis, is employed in a range of biomechanics specialties, including impact biomechanics and surgical planning. These models rely on accurate material properties for skeletal muscle, which comprises roughly 40% of the human body. Due to surrounding tissues, compressed skeletal muscle in vivo likely experiences a semi-confined state. Nearly all previous studies investigating passively compressed muscle at the tissue level have focused on muscle in unconfined compression. The goals of this study were to (1) examine the stiffness and time-dependent material properties of skeletal muscle subjected to both confined and unconfined compression (2) develop a model that captures passive muscle mechanics under both conditions and (3) determine the extent to which different assumptions of volumetric behavior affect model results. Muscle in confined compression exhibited stiffer behavior, agreeing with previous assumptions of near-incompressibility. Stress relaxation was found to be faster under unconfined compression, suggesting there may be different mechanisms that support load these two conditions. Finite element calibration was achieved through nonlinear optimization (normalized root mean square error &lt;6%) and model validation was strong (normalized root mean square error &lt;17%). Comparisons to commonly employed assumptions of bulk behavior showed that a simple one parameter approach does not accurately simulate confined compression. We thus recommend the use of a properly calibrated, nonlinear bulk constitutive model for modeling of skeletal muscle in vivo.

The plates have a symmetric lay-up and loaded along their contour by the in-plane forces. The consideration employs the von Karman approach. The lay-up optimality conditions for a single-mode (lowest) buckling eigenvalue are derived using the proper variational principles and the variation calculus. Both the bending terms and the terms following from the redistribution of the 2D stresses over the plate are taken into account. The optimality conditions contain two items (corresponding to the bending and to the 2D infinitesimal plane strains). The comparative analysis of the items is performed. The physical meaning of the optimality conditions is demonstrated and explained. An illustration to the derived conditions is presented and analyzed. It is shown that for the optimal lay-up not all lamination parameters are independent on each other (one of them is a linearly dependent one).

bg4m7,"Bitstream Photon Counting Chirped AM Lidar with a Digital Logic Local Oscillator","This paper introduces a new concept for the local oscillator (LO) for the Photon Counting Chirped Amplitude Modulation Lidar (PC-CAML). Rather than using a radio-frequency (RF) analog LO applied electronically either in post-detection mixing or via opto-electronic mixing (OEM) at the detector, or applied via pre-detection mixing using an optical intensity modulator as in previous systems, the new method mixes the single-bit binary counts from the photon counting detector with a single-bit binary LO using an AND binary digital logic gate. This type of LO is called the Digital Logic Local Oscillator (DLLO), and the resulting PC-CAML system is a type of bitstream lidar called bitstream PC-CAML (patent pending).

The key advantage of the DLLO in the bitstream PC-CAML is that it replaces bulky, power-hungry, and expensive wideband RF analog electronics with single-bit digital logic components that can be implemented in inexpensive silicon complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) read-out integrated circuits (ROICs) to make the bitstream PC-CAML with a DLLO more suitable for compact lidar-on-a-chip systems and lidar array receivers than previous PCCAML systems.

Particularly, the problem of estimating the displacement field in a soft shallow layer overlying rigid bedrock induced by simple SH wave excitation has been favored by engineers due to its simplicity combined with inherent relevance for practical scenarios. We here derive analytical, accurate estimates for both the fundamental frequency and the amplitude of the first resonant mode of such systems by applying an intuitive argument based on resonance of single-degree-of-freedom systems. Our estimates do not presuppose a continuous velocity distribution, and can be used for fast assessment of site response in seismic hazard assessment and engineering design. On the basis of the said estimates of fundamental frequency and amplitude, we next propose a novel definition of ``equivalent homogeneous shear modulus’’ of the inhomogeneous deposit; and we show that the response of the fundamental mode of these systems is governed by the mechanical properties of the layers closer to the bedrock.

The key equations derived in this approach are based on the principle of virtual works written under the ordinary state based peridynamic formalism for two-dimensional isotropic linear elasticity. In-house codes including a minimization process have also been developed to implement the method. A three-point bending test and two independent virtual fields arbitrarily chosen are used as a case study throughout the paper. The numerical validation of the virtual fields method has been performed on the case study by simulating the displacement field by finite element analysis. This field has been used to extract the elastic material properties and compared them to those used as input in the finite element model, showing the robustness of the approach. Noise analysis and the effect of the missing displacement fields on the specimen’s edges to simulate digital image correlation limitations have also been studied in the numerical part. This work focuses on pre-damage properties to demonstrate the feasibility of the method and provides a new tool for using full-field measurements within peridynamics with a reduced calculation time as there is no need to compute the displacement field. Future works will deal with damage properties which is the main strength of peridynamics.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dc0e5eb96af97000d183462/,338,https://engrxiv.org/uv8m7/,10.31224/osf.io/uv8m7,10.1007/s42102-019-00025-7,2019-11-05T19:35:00.089207,2020-01-24T02:45:50.674547

Here, we review several classes of materials such as simple metals, semiconductors, high-k dielectrics, polar materials, zero gap materials, as well as structured materials that can support strongly localized electromagnetic modes at material interfaces in the Terahertz spectral range. We present the basic theory of surface waves, detail the requirement of strong modal confinement and low loss for the surface waves propagating at material interfaces and discuss challenges for excitation of such modes at Terahertz frequencies. A large number of examples related to naturally occurring and artificial materials is then presented. A variety of practical applications is envisioned for surface waves at Terahertz frequencies including non-destructive super-resolution imaging and quality control, high sensitivity sensors capable of operation with small volumes of analytes that are opaque in the visible and near-infrared, as well as design of compact optical circuit for the upcoming ultra-high bitrate THz communication devices.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dc0c8c6e18a3c000dc5261f/,258,https://engrxiv.org/ga4vs/,10.31224/osf.io/ga4vs,,2019-11-05T01:36:22.643738,2019-11-05T01:38:01.734112
sfkwv,"Finite Element Model of Composite Connections Strengthened with CFRP Laminates","Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) materials are being widely used for structural applications. Despite the relatively high cost of the CFRP materials, their high strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance as well as easy handling and installation have made them widely popular for different civil engineering applications where increased strength and/or ductility is important. This thesis investigates the moment-rotational response of an endplate composite connection including strengthening of the slab by using different sizes and thickness of CFRP sheets in hogging moment regions and different reinforcement bar ratios by using finite element simulations. A three dimensional non-linear model is developed in ANSYS to study the feasibility of decreasing the reinforcing bars in the presence of the CFRP laminate in hogging moment regions of the slab. The verification of the analysis is carried out to calibrate the un-strengthened model by available experimental results obtained from a series of composite connection tests as reported by other researchers. The moment resistance for the partial depth endplate composite connection obtained by ANSYS 12.1 software is found to be very close to the corresponding laboratory test value. From the results it can be observed that applying CFRP sheets to the tension face of composite slab can reduce the amount of steel reinforcement bars required for flexural strength of composite connections.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dbf8a70f3bb87000d90918f/,419,https://engrxiv.org/sfkwv/,10.31224/osf.io/sfkwv,,2019-11-04T14:30:20.359329,2020-07-31T17:02:00.199332

zrt52,"IMPROVING THERMO-OPTIC PROPERTIES OF SMART WINDOWS VIA COUPLING TO RADIATIVE COOLERS","In this work we first solve the radiative heat transfer problem in one dimension to perform a comparative analysis of the time averaged performance of the partially transparent radiative windows and radiative coolers. In doing so we clearly distinguish the design goals for the partially transparent windows and radiative coolers and provide optimal choice for the material parameters to realize these goals. Thus, radiative coolers are normally non-transparent in the visible, and the main goal is to design a cooler with the temperature of its dark side as low as possible relative to that of the atmosphere. For the radiative windows, however, their surfaces are necessarily partially transparent in the visible. In the cooling mode the main question is rather about the maximal visible light transmission through the window at which the temperature on the window somber side does not exceed that of the atmosphere. We then demonstrate that transmission of the visible light through smart windows can be significantly increased (by as much as a factor of 2) without additional heating of the windows via coupling of the windows to the radiative coolers using transparent cooling liquid that flows inside of the window and radiative cooler structures. We demonstrate that efficient heat exchange between radiative coolers and smart windows can be realized using small coolant velocities (sub 1mm/s for ~1m-large windows) or even using a purely passive gravitationally driven coolant flows between a hot smart window and a cold radiative cooler mounted on top of the window with only a minimal temperature differential (sub-1K) between the two. We believe that our simple models complimented with an in-depth comparative analysis of the standalone and coupled smart windows and radiative coolers can be of interest to a broad scientific community pursuing research in these disciplines.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dbe1bfdcfc96c000ec8288b/,306,https://engrxiv.org/zrt52/,10.31224/osf.io/zrt52,,2019-11-03T16:57:43.766665,2019-11-03T16:58:01.966862

This paper considers Ethereum, a leading block chain. We deep dive into the nature of this block chain, wherein for software upgrades forks are performed. They types of forks and impact is discussed. A specific Ethereum hack led to a hard fork and focus is provided on understanding the hack and overcoming it from a novel approach. The current model has been unable to handle multiple Ethereum attacks. Thus the current approach is compared against a novel approach providing a security and scaling solution.

8sxcd,"An artificial neural network model for predicting characteristic input parameters for physics based modelling of drying process","Drying is crucial in the quality preservation of food materials. Physics-based models are effective tools to optimally control the drying process. However, these models require accurate thermo-physical properties; unavailability or uncertainty in the values of these properties increases the possibility of error. Property estimation methods are not standardized, and usually involve the use of many instruments and are time-consuming. In this work, we have developed an experimentally validated deep learning-based artificial neural network model that estimates sensitive input parameters of food materials using temperature and moisture data from a set of simple experiments. This model predicts input parameters with error less than 1%. Further, using input parameters, physics-based model predicts temperature and moisture to within 5% accuracy of experiments. The proposed work when interfaced with food machinery could play a significant role in process optimization in food processing industries.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dbd998bf3bb87000c8b1540/,353,https://engrxiv.org/8sxcd/,10.31224/osf.io/8sxcd,,2019-11-02T18:25:17.142118,2019-11-02T18:25:42.643861
j5zb7,"Mechanisms and Occurrence of Detonations in Vapor Cloud Explosions","Not all accidental releases of ﬂammable gases and vapors create explosions. Most releases do not ﬁnd an ignition source, and of those that do ignite, most of them result in deﬂagrations that generate low or moderate overpressures. Under some circumstances, however, it is possible for deﬂagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) to occur, and this can be followed by a propagating detonation that quickly consumes the remaining detonable cloud. In a detonable cloud, a detonation creates the worst accident that can happen. Because detonation overpressures are much higher than those in a deﬂagration and continue through the entire detonable cloud, the damage from a DDT event is more severe.
This paper ﬁrst provides a brief summary of our knowledge to date of the fundamental mechanisms of ﬂame acceleration and DDT. This information is then contrasted to and combined with evidence of detonations (detonation markers) obtained from large-scale tests and actual large vapor cloud explosions (VCEs), including events at Bunceﬁeld (UK), Jaipur (India), CAPECO (Puerto Rico), and Port Hudson (US). The major conclusion from this review is that detonations did occur in prior VCEs in at least part of the VCE accidents. Finally, actions are suggested that could be taken to minimize detonation hazards.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dbcbf58cfc96c000cc1a05f/,326,https://engrxiv.org/j5zb7/,10.31224/osf.io/j5zb7,,2019-11-02T18:23:26.524601,2019-11-02T18:23:42.630401

4uqb2,"A simplified model for predicting shrinkage during low temperature air drying of porous food materials","Food materials shrink when they are air-dried. However, owing largely to the complexity of modelling, most drying models so far have neglected this shrinkage, leading to inaccurate predictions. The empirical nature, inability to yield data on location-specific deformations and computational cost of detailed poro-mechanistic analyses and complex deformation modelling approaches make them unattractive for models that could be used in real-time process control algorithms. In this work, we develop a simplified transport model to predict spatial and temporal shrinkage during low temperature air drying process, and validate the model with experiments. In such drying, volumetric change is dominated by moisture loss; therefore the role of gas induced porosity is neglected. This model predicts shrinkage, temperature and moisture content at each spatial location at time intervals during the drying process. The model agrees well with experiments conducted by us (reported in this paper) as well as with those conducted by others (taken from the literature) on food samples.  We expect that this generalized model will find wide applications in the food processing industry.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dbbb71ecfc96c000bc15556/,119,https://engrxiv.org/4uqb2/,10.31224/osf.io/4uqb2,,2019-11-01T17:02:12.916163,2019-11-01T17:02:42.655160
k8nec,"Finite Element Analysis of Precast Concrete Connections under Incremental load","Beam-to-column connections affect the rigidity and strength of the overall precast concrete structures. Even though many experimental researches have been carried out on beam-to-column connections, the behavior and failure mode of the connection in precast concrete is often difficult to assess through experimental program. The finite element analysis, on the other hand, can be an option to properly evaluate the condition of the connections. Nevertheless, the finite element analysis on the beam-to-column connections is quite limited. Thus, there is a need to study and explore the behavior of the connection system based on the finite element data. In this research, the finite element analysis was performed to study the performance of different types of beam-to-column connections in precast concrete frames. A total of four specimens were modeled and analyzed to study the connection behavior involving load-displacement relationship under static incremental load.

qwcav,"Thin X ray Lens Design And Simulation","A proposal of thin sandwich mirror array lens for X-ray telescope Wolter type lens is discussed.    We discussed a process of design, fabrication of this thin X-ray lens and conducted a simulation and provided a measurement method for lens focal quality.  The lens consists of two connected layers of arrays of rings of mirrors, one is of parabolic mirror and another is of hyperbolic mirrors.  In each layer, the mirror coating is deposited on a substrate and next substrate in turn is deposited on this mirror film, leaving no air gap.  Repeat this process to form an array of mirrors.  Hence form a solid thin disc sandwich mirror lens and each ring of mirror can be curved precisely by polishing process.  X ray travels into the transparent substrate and grazes on the surface of the mirror coating facing the substrate.   Using geometrical optics ray tracing, we conducted simulation with two artificial distance stars as the source objects, a virtual lens of mirror array and a disc placed at the focal plane as the receiver CCD.  Simulation shows that the star located off optical axis forms corn shape patterns by its ray crossing pointa on CCD disc.  Those patterns may provide the baseline pattern for further image deconvolution or aberration reducing algorithm.  The corn pattern is related to the dimensional structure of the lens and the space location of the star; hence, it contains some information about space location of the star.  A simulation of ray tracing video is made as well.

dxt6u,"*Locating an iBeacon with GPS, using amateur radio VHF and the AMSAT  satellite PSAT, NO-84, cubesat, using AX.25.*","Abstract:
Resupply by airdropping or drone-shipping is a new resupply strategy in backpacking. In preparation for reconnaissance in long distance backpacking and SAR activities in remote areas, with little or no development, we consider the use of amateur radio with GPS beacons for resupply tracking
and geo-tagging. 
While 6G communications using GPS satellites are available for mountaineering beacons, we use a dual strategy with an additional amateur radio based AX.25 packet radio using the PSAT based cubesat for publishing location information.
Additionally, two cargo iTag locating satellites, bot cubesats are also used for iTag location and the automatic publication of tag locations on geocaching.com. The satellites are AENEAS and PTecSAT.
A logistics exercise is introduced, proposed to be conducted at Uncas Scientific Area, near Big Lake, MN, with an operations logistik for the spanning of drop locations and radio fox hunt, using a reconnaissance track, mobile cache device.
Keywords: iTag, iBeacon, AMSAT, cubesat, AENEAS, PTecSAT, 6G, AX.25, resupply, mountaineering and backpacking, SAR.

What: 
The AMSAT AENEAS(“Technical Details for Satellite AENEAS” n.d.), PTecSAT(“IARU Sat Coordinator” n.d.) satellite is used for resupply iBeacon tracking, with a payload of water sachets and soylent coffee packs, for mountaineering resupply logistics. Radio Fox Hunting combined with alpining is defined as a newer, ultralight backpacking technique.
How:
iBeacons, defining 100msec bursts at 2.425GHz are designed with the minimum wattage needed for detection on the field by the AENEAS satellite. 100 such packages containing 1-liter pouches of potable water and three meals of soylent of 87 grams each. This proof of concept study is to be conducted at Uncas Dunes Scientific and Natural Area (SNA), with an area of 658.3 acres , we have a density of airdropping of 6.58 acres per package, leading to an average distance of 26628.32 square meters, by pi/4 d^2, d is 184 meters in circle close packing model.
We determine an optimal trajectory for the radio fox hunt over a published geotag distribution of 100 resupply caches.


Why:
Resupply strategies, form an important role in long distance mountaineering and backpacking missions, for wilderness areas with little or no little development, for example the pacific crest trail, in the united states, a strong resupply strategy along with an armada of reconnaissance track mobile caches are needed for effective mountaineering and/or search and rescue operations, with a resilience plan for extreme weather operations.
The use of 6G like simulated communication is possible by using better encryption and packet compression over a slower AX.25 network, with the use of A.I based technologies like image cartoonization and feature representation and speech to text conversion for lower bandwidth requirements.

So What:
The use of reconnaissance tracks, along with airdropped resupply, will improve the efficiency and quality of mountaineering and provide vital air support for search and rescue operations. Resupply beacons also provide supplies for hikers or backpackers lost in the wilderness and also provide emergency communication hotspots as the beacons are still active to transreceiver emergency messages.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5db8839ef3bb87000d88aa46/,159,https://engrxiv.org/dxt6u/,10.31224/osf.io/dxt6u,,2019-10-30T17:38:41.385040,2019-10-30T17:39:22.676805
4myqe,"High salinity enhances adsorption of 17α-ethinyl estradiol by polyethersulfone membrane: Isotherm modelling and molecular simulation","The increasing occurrence of steroidal hormone micropollutant in the aquatic environment and their associated consequences have caused serious environmental concerns globally. Adsorptive removal of hormonal pollutants using polymeric membranes have been suggested but information on their performance in various environmental conditions is lacking. In this study, we examined the effect of salinity on the performance of polyethersulfone (PES) membrane to remove synthetic hormone 17α-ethinyl estradiol (EE2) from water. Our results show that an increase of salinity from 0 to 3% results in an improved retention of EE2 onto PES membrane from 79.3% to 98.7%. The experimental results fit the Freundlich isotherm model better as compared to the Langmuir model. The Freundlich parameters n and Kf yielded the highest values at 3% salinity. Molecular simulation results suggest that a high salinity increases the binding energy between EE2 and PES membranes, promoting the PES-EE2 interaction through pi-pi interaction, hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction. This study provides valuable information for improving treatment plant design to allow better removal of EE2 and other low-polar organic contaminants from water via membrane-based sorption-elution method, and may also serves as a proof-of-concept in adsorptive removal of organic contaminants in the pre-treatment process of seawater prior to desalination to reduce burden on reverse osmosis membranes.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5db82a7ccfc96c000dbf489b/,122,https://engrxiv.org/4myqe/,10.31224/osf.io/4myqe,,2019-10-29T15:45:45.350271,2019-10-29T15:46:07.316812

This thesis proposes deep learning architectures to improve automatic object localization and boundary delineation for salient object segmentation in natural images and for 2D medical image segmentation. First, we propose and evaluate a novel dilated dense encoder-decoder architecture with a custom dilated spatial pyramid pooling block to accurately localize and delineate boundaries for salient object segmentation. The dilation offers better spatial understanding and the dense connectivity preserves features learned at shallower levels of the network for better localization.

Second, we propose and evaluate a custom 2D dilated dense UNet architecture for accurate lesion localization and segmentation in medical images. This architecture can be utilized as a stand alone segmentation framework or used as a rich feature extracting backbone to aid other models in medical image segmentation.

7ce89,"Safety Analysis of Molten Salt Fast Reactor Fuel Composition using Moltres","The Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) has garnered much interest for its inherent safety and sustainbility features. The MSFR can adopt a closed thorium fuel cycle for sustainable operation through the breeding of 233 U from 232 Th. The fuel composition changes significantly over the course of its lifespan. In this study, we investigated the steady state and transient behavior of the MSFR using Moltres, a coupled neutronics/thermal-hydraulics code developed within the Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) framework. Three different fuel compositions, start-up, early-life, and equilibrium, were examined for potentially dangerous core temperature excursions during a unprotected loss of heat sink (ULOHS) accident. The six-group and total neutron flux distributions showed good agreement with SERPENT and published MSFR results, while the temperature distribution and total power showed discrepancies which can be attributed to
known sources of error. For the transient behavior under the ULOHS scenario, while the transition time towards the new steady state core temperature is also in good agreement with existing MSFR simulations by Fiorina et al., Moltres under-
estimated the temperature rise by a factor of ten, due to the same sources of error affecting the steady state results. While an MSFR loaded with start-up fuel composition operates at a higher temperature than with the other two fuel compositions, all three cases were shown to be inherently safe due to the
strong negative temperature feedback.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5db1f0ac365cb8000ad91e53/,470,https://engrxiv.org/7ce89/,10.31224/osf.io/7ce89,,2019-10-24T22:34:01.085875,2019-12-12T00:10:46.741004

近年來中國大力推動電動車輛的商業化與普及化，導致汰役電池逐漸增加，造成環保威脅與資源浪費的問題。因此積極推動汰役電池的回收與利用。目前已經公布「新能源汽車動力蓄電池回收利用管理暫行辦法」，及相關法規與標準，並建立與推廣動力電池溯源管理平台，同時輔導產業界配合執行。本文主要在說明中國汰役電池回收利用的推動制度與現況，包括編碼規則、溯源管理、設廠規範、拆解規範、餘能量測等，並分析其政府單位與民間企業的推動情形，同時檢討我國相關發展狀況。我國目前電動車輛尚在初期推廣階段，目前主要為電動巴士與電動機車，相關回收政策仍在研擬中，因此中國與國際已有的法規、標準與做法，值得我們做為未來推動汰役電池回收再利用的參考。(本文已發表於台灣能源期刊 6 (2019) 425-451, 連結: https://km.twenergy.org.tw/Publication/thesis_more?id=234 )",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5db1ec160db187000d3b350d/,679,https://engrxiv.org/nxv7f/,10.31224/osf.io/nxv7f,,2019-10-24T22:32:58.803316,2020-01-01T05:01:34.628117
d4n3s,"Summary of Safety Standards for Repurposing Batteries (汰役電池安全標準的內容與說明)","Accompanied by the increase of electric vehicles, repurposing batteries will increase rapidly as well in the future. How to deal with these batteries has become an open-ended question. Some retired power batteries possess about 80% initial capacity. So they can be utilized once again, for example, to serve the batteries in the energy storage system. However, this may cause safety problems. Underwriters Laboratories (UL) published the safety standard for batteries for use in stationary, vehicle auxiliary power, and light electric rail applications in 2013 (UL 1973) to respond to the said issues. To promote wide-ranged applications, UL published the safety standard for repurposing battery evaluation in 2018 (UL 1974). In this paper, we summarize the contents of UL 1973 and UL 1974 as a reference to accelerate the industrial development of battery energy storage system.

隨著電動車輛的推廣與增加，汰役電池開始出現，未來數量將會快速增長，因此成為一個必須要解決的問題。這些動力電池在淘汰時，部分仍然有大約80% 的容量，顯然可以再次加以利用，例如做為儲能電池之使用。但由於是此類淘汰物品可能出現安全上的問題。Underwriters Laboratories (UL)公司在2013年提出電池於儲能系統的安全標準(UL 1973)來因應此問題，但為面對汰役電池推廣之需求，於2018年出版二次利用電池安全評估標準(UL 1974)。本文係參考UL 1973與UL 1974兩個標準，就電池儲能系統的發展現況，將這些標準加以整理與說明，供使用者參考，期能加速電池儲能系統的產業發展。

6nw7f,"Behavior of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 in a sulfur and zinc-rich medium and its applications for biosensing and biomaterials","An  increasing  focus  of  current  microbiology  research  is  the  fact  that  some strains of bacteria, called dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria (DMRB), are capable  of  utilizing  certain  metallic  ions  as  terminal  electron  acceptors  in their  metabolic  processes.  One  strain  in  particular,  Shewanella  oneidensis MR-1,  can  reduce  ions  of  iron,  lead,  arsenic,  and  uranium,  among  others. Under  anaerobic  conditions  it  has  also  been  shown  to  reduce  sulfur compounds,  nitrates,  and  chromates.  The  cultivation  of  DMRB  under controlled  conditions  therefore  has  significant  implications  for  the  low-energy,  room-temperature  synthesis  of  metal  sulfide  and/or  metal  oxide semiconductors.  Furthermore,  Shewanella  and  other  DMRB  can  form biofilms  that  interact  electronically  with  solid-phase  minerals  in  their environment.  For  this  reason  there  exists  a  potential  to  grow  DMRB directly  into  porous  substrates  in  order  to  create  biosensors  that  are capable  of  producing  electrical  signals  that  provide  information  about metal  ion  concentration  in  water  as  well  as  a  range  of  other  water  quality variables.I  will  highlight  my  recent  work  exploring  the  behavior  of  Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, in a medium rich in both zinc and thiosulfate ions. I have grown  Shewanella  bacteria  in  a  three-electrode  system  and  used  a potentiostat  to  hold  the  system  at  a  fixed  DC  voltage  during  cultivation while also measuring current output. After completing the cultivation step, I    have    used    cyclic    voltammetry    and    electrochemical    impedance spectroscopy  to  characterize  the  DC  and  AC  current-voltage  dynamics  of the  system,  which  can  reveal  the  reduction-oxidation  activity  of  key bacterial  proteins.  In  the  second  experiment,  I  have  grown  Shewanella bacteria under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions in media rich  in zinc and  thiosulfate  ions  and  used  scanning  electron  microscopy  and  energy dispersive  microscopy  to  characterize  the  minerals  that  precipitate  within the batches. I compare results from a minimal medium containing only the zinc  and  thiosulfate  sources  to  a more  traditional  Shewanella  medium containing  various  vitamins,  minerals  and  other  nutrients  to  support growth.  I  also  compare  the  inoculated  batches  to  sterile  control  batches containing no bacteria in order to infer the effect that the bacteria have on mineralization  in  their  environment.  Finally,  I  use  confocal  microscopy  to explore  the  fluorescence  behavior  of  the  precipitates  generated  in  both inoculated and sterile batches.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5db091690db187000d39e4c6/,188,https://engrxiv.org/6nw7f/,10.31224/osf.io/6nw7f,,2019-10-23T19:23:30.702221,2019-10-23T19:23:45.944833
38ktu,"Solar cooking potential in Switzerland : nodal modelling and optimisation","Solar cooking is one possible solution to reduce the domination of fossil fuel in the domestic sector and to benefit the renewable energy. This study assesses the solar cooking potential in Switzerland. A suited nodal model, based on energy balance equations of a box-type solar cooker is implemented in Matlab. Model parameters that cannot be determined experimentally or analytically are evaluated through an optimization procedure based on a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The model is able to predict the temperature of the cooking vessel with average relative error around 5%. Based on its reliability, the model is simulated over a year for different locations in Switzerland in order to determine the solar cooking potential. It is characterized by a metric which represents the number of days a year the oven could be used to cook potatoes for two persons. It is found that the cooking times of potatoes can be well predicted by an Arrhenius law with an activation energy of 74.14 kJ/mol. A potatoes cooking criterion is based on the Arrhenius equation and determines if the pot simulated temperature profile of a particular day allows to cook potatoes. The North-East of Switzerland is the least favourable area to solar cooking with theoretically around 155 cooking days per year. Around 240 cooking days are estimated in the Valais and the Grisons cantons, which represent a significant potential for solar cooking in Switzerland.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5db004960db187000e3984fd/,370,https://engrxiv.org/38ktu/,10.31224/osf.io/38ktu,10.1016/j.solener.2019.10.071,2019-10-23T14:12:00.345235,2019-11-25T08:40:08.253529
f9va7,"The Parenting Experience.: A Soul Machines like Demonstration(™)","Abstract:
A virtual parenting experience, inspired by babyX of soul machines, as part of one’s digital life is explored as transcription from digital DNA. Algorithms are presented, using the open Daz3D framework with the Unity engine. An emphasis is placed on an anime reality and anime assets in creating the digital identity. A study on the role of loving kindness, compassion and natural education,  humane education by real parenting, in the bringing up and the emergent digital personalities of virtual children is explored. 

Keywords: Natural Balance, parenting experience, alternatives to adoption, BabyX, Machine DNA

What:
Given the long waiting times and the legal formalities involved in adoption, to an end to a parenting experience, we present a virtual parenting experience based on a digital human on SaaS augmentation, with an emphasis on non physical reality , but an anime space, for an experience. Such experiences can be as realistic as a few decades long and are possible given the shift towards the cloud computing paradigm. We present a design for machine DNA based aging, parenting and bringing up, emphasising the natural balance, loving kindness and compassion, in alternative schooling, rather than a stick and carrot approach of reinforcement learning.
How:
We define a non linear time based template system based on the Genesis universal assets for male and female children, with a machine genome for the assets and define an aging model for uniform transcription with heuristics for social, spiritual, emotional and computational intelligence.
Why:
Given the extinction of many indigenous species, especially in Europe, Asia, Americas and the older Eurasia, is the need for machine evolution, the adoption of virtual parenting experiences and the knowledge of digital human identities. Can the parenting experience form a part of this identity, the need for the constant loving kindness, the warmth and humanity of human parenting. We explore this issue in this paper.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dae220962b630000c6287e6/,146,https://engrxiv.org/f9va7/,10.31224/osf.io/f9va7,,2019-10-23T14:10:09.870102,2019-10-23T18:26:23.430428
yp2j7,"Critical Flow Centrality Measures on Interdependent Networks with Time-Varying Demands","This paper applies centrality measures based on critical flows to interdependent networks in which demands vary over time. These component importance measures combine classical flow centrality with concepts from critical infrastructure protection. In a previous work, the utility of critical flows was demonstrated on a flow network that represented a single infrastructure system with static demands. The present work considers the setting where multiple infrastructure systems are interlinked through physical and geospatial dependencies, and where demands for resources vary over time. Since critical flow measures are specific to flow patterns, and not to static network topology, the identification of critical elements requires statistical means. This paper demonstrates one such approach, leaving avenues open for future research. It also presents two forms of reliability analysis based on critical flows - a composite measure using edge reliability, and component failure/degradation analysis.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dacdbd2d9fac4000aa68b34/,310,https://engrxiv.org/yp2j7/,10.31224/osf.io/yp2j7,,2019-10-21T02:48:08.968199,2019-10-30T23:55:43.695360
ksg2p,"Shear Wave Speeds Track Axial Stress in Porcine Collateral Ligaments","Ligament tension is an important factor that can affect the success of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures. However, surgeons currently lack objective approaches for assessing tension in a particular ligament intraoperatively. The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of noninvasive shear wave tensiometry to characterize stress in medial and lateral collateral ligaments (MCLs and LCLs) ex vivo. Nine porcine MCL and LCL specimens were subjected to cyclic axial loading while wave speeds were measured using laser vibrometry. We found that squared shear wave speed increased linearly with stress in both the MCL (r2avg = 0.94) and LCL (r2avg = 0.98). Wave speeds were slightly lower in the MCL than the LCL when subjected to comparable axial stress (p &lt; 0.001). Ligament-specific wave speeds may arise from differences in geometry and stress distributions between ligaments. These observations suggest it may be feasible to use noninvasive shear wave speed measures as a proxy of ligament loading during orthopedic procedures such as TKA.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dab8893f1b0a9000a6485af/,127,https://engrxiv.org/ksg2p/,10.31224/osf.io/ksg2p,,2019-10-20T18:02:30.952447,2019-10-20T18:03:03.419628
5wv2d,"A Rationale for Backprojection in Spotlight Synthetic Aperture Radar Image Formation","This note on backprojection for spotlight synthetic aperture radar image formation is mainly pedagogic in purpose and is intended to be accessible. The presentation is elementary and detailed, beginning with the wave equation and melding wave notions with signal processing notions using a compact and consistent notation throughout. A reflection model is developed including a general expression for the receiver signal which does not depend on a particular transmitted waveform. Then the signal is specialized to monochromatic waves to show how waves and the Fourier transform fit together. In the end the signal is once again generalized so that the theory works for any signal type. Backprojection is shown to reconstruct the wave field that was lost by sampling it at only one point, the receiving antenna. After specializing some details to the synthetic aperture radar geometry, the Projection Slice Theorem is introduced late, after an understanding of the underlying principles is obtained. Computational aspects are considered and it is seen that backprojection and direct Fourier inversion, also known as Polar Format Algorithm, are fundamentally the same, differing only in some implementation details, albeit significant ones, thus overturning the notion that backprojection is not a Fourier process. Those who might benefit from this paper include people who have worked in this field and who seek a somewhat different point of view from the usual presentation, people in other fields who are unfamiliar with some of the engineering concepts involved, and signal processing engineers who appreciate a bit of wave theory.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5daa72eff1b0a9000d651b3d/,284,https://engrxiv.org/5wv2d/,10.31224/osf.io/5wv2d,,2019-10-19T13:39:20.009838,2020-07-16T14:32:16.011737

u3nej,"Biosynthesis of Molybdenum Disulfide Nanoparticles Using The Metal-Reducing Bacterium Shewanella Oneidensis MR-1","The bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 is a dissimilatory metal-reducing bacterium capable of performing anaerobic respiration using a metal as terminal electron acceptor. Isolated from Lake Oneida in Upstate New York, S. oneidensis MR-1 was first noted for its manganese-reducing capability, but has now been shown to reduce a range of metal ions such as Fe(III), Mn(IV), As(V) and Cr(VI), as well as sulfur anions such as thiosulfate and sulfite. In the lab, Shewanella has been grown anaerobically in media enhanced with sulfur and metal ions in order to produce several types of chalcogenide nanoparticles, such as zinc sulfide and arsenic trisulfide.

Given the utility of chalcogenide materials for electronics and photonics applications, bacterially-synthesized chalcogenide nanoparticles present a tantalizing avenue for green chemistry. Compared to similar materials produced using traditional chemical synthesis methods, bacterially-synthesized nanomaterials can be produced at much lower temperatures and using fewer chemical reagents. This work presents a method of synthesizing molybdenum disulfide nanoparticles using S. oneidensis bacteria. Molybdenum disulfide is a layered semiconductor with an indirect band gap in its bulk state and a direct bandgap in its monolayer state. It also exhibits changes in its electronic properties when its surfaces are functionalized with molecules, giving it applications for both photodetection and biosensing. An anaerobic batch culture of S. oneidensis MR-1 was incubated at room temperature in the presence of molybdenum oxide, resulting in the production of molybdenum disulfide crystals less than a micron in diameter. These crystals were detected using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, absorbance spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. In addition to confirming that molybdenum disulfide can be produced by Shewanella bacteria, the data collected using these methods provide insight on the size, morphology and photoresponse of nanoparticles generated this way. The findings also allow inferences to be made about how the confluence of several mechanisms present in an anaerobic Shewanella culture combine to make such a synthesis possible, while providing clues about how such processes can be further improved or extended to other materials.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da8847e62b630000d5e6a76/,282,https://engrxiv.org/u3nej/,10.31224/osf.io/u3nej,,2019-10-17T15:30:48.820564,2019-10-23T17:51:55.818341

Generally, engine performance improvement efforts will lead to increase in fuel consumption. However, this problem can be solved by implementing engine torque control based on intelligent regulation such as the fuzzy logic inference system. In this study, fuzzy logic engine torque regulation is used to control the throttle position entered by the driver to achieve optimal engine torque. An engine torque vs. throttle position and engine speed mapping for vehicles with economical function is used to build this control process regulation. From the simulation result, it can be concluded that this control strategy is very effective to reduce fuel consumption and simultaneously to optimize the engine performance.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da82100ec1775000efc61a1/,109,https://engrxiv.org/bue86/,10.31224/osf.io/bue86,,2019-10-19T13:32:55.067646,2019-10-26T05:06:55.798713

fh8m6,"Data-driven stochastic model for basin and sub-grid variability of SMAP satellite soil moisture","This study focused on the utility of coarse surface soil moisture observations for applications that require high resolution surface soil moisture information. This was accomplished by quantifying the information content of average soil moisture for three different spatial scales of 81 km2, 790 km2, and 4,400 km2. In situ point observations of soil moisture from 31 stations in Iowa were used to develop a spatial stochastic model that assumes hillslope-scale model parameters are independent. Soil moisture dry-downs and wetting regimes were analyzed using rain gauge and soil moisture sensor data. The statistical nature of dry-downs were parameterized using a power-law decay, and soil moisture increases due to rainfall were parameterized using a non-dimensional logistic curve that is a function of soil moisture deficit. The resulting stochastic model is used to quantify the magnitude of the standard deviation, σ(θ), and skewness G(θ) as a function of the areal average. We show that the greatest information content (small spatial standard deviation) of average observation corresponded to values near the minimum or the maximum soil moisture with σ(θ) &lt; 5%, while average observations for intermediate soil moisture values had the lowest information content with σ(θ) &gt; 20%. The differences in information content as a function of the areal average were consistent with the statistical nature of soil moisture that can be interpreted as small range bounded variable. However, this study provides quantitative estimates for the magnitude of the sub-grid and basin scale variability, documenting the utility for applications that require high resolution information. These results form the basis for the investigation of spatial runoff production in response to rainfall and to inform plot scale agriculture applications.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da5f49626eb50000d812b63/,275,https://engrxiv.org/fh8m6/,10.31224/osf.io/fh8m6,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.06.026,2019-10-15T20:20:15.802129,2019-10-15T22:01:05.061558
vauf7,"Investigating the role of antecedent SMAP satellite soil moisture, radar rainfall and MODIS vegetation on runoff production in an agricultural region","Following results by Crow et al. (2017) [Geophys. Res. Lett. 44, 5495-5503] on the impact of antecedent soil moisture on runoff production, we investigate total runoff production during individual rainfall-runoff events in agricultural landscapes as a function of antecedent soil moisture, total rainfall, and vegetation cover for catchments with drainage areas ranging from 80-1000 km2 in the state of Iowa, USA. For our study, we use Enhanced SMAP soil moisture estimates, the MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI), gauge-corrected Stage IV radar rainfall, and USGS streamflow data. We analyze the event runoff ratio as a function of event-scale rainfall, antecedent SMAP soil moisture and soil-moisture-deficit-normalized rainfall for the events in a period from March 31, 2015 to October 31, 2018. Our goal is to confirm the relationships identified by Crow et al. (2017) in heavily managed agricultural landscapes and to refine some of their methodological steps to quantify the role of additional variables controlling runoff production. To this end, we define three different strategies to identify rainfall-runoff events and add a baseflow separation step to better insulate event scale stormflow runoff. We test the effects of antecedent soil moisture, rainfall, and vegetation on the event-scale runoff ratio. The antecedent SMAP soil moisture and event-scale rainfall are found to have significant predictive power in estimating event runoff ratio. Soil moisture deficit-normalized rainfall, introduced as the ratio of event-scale rainfall to available space in top soil before initiation of the event, exhibited a more distinct relationship with runoff ratio. The long-term analysis of runoff ratio, rainfall, and MODIS EVI indicated that, in an agricultural region, vegetation plays a significant role in determining event-scale runoff ratios. The methodology and outcome of our study have direct implications on real-time flood forecasting and long-term hydrologic assessments.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da5f359a7bc73000bedc9ee/,287,https://engrxiv.org/vauf7/,10.31224/osf.io/vauf7,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124210,2019-10-15T20:19:06.307485,2019-10-15T22:01:05.035498

The current sensors are based on the Ampere Force Law (AFL), defining the magnetic force between two parallel wire carrying currents. These current sensors can be used for detecting/sensing DC and AC currents as well as their combination in a single wire or multiple wires, and they do not rely on any permanent magnets for operation. In the first configuration, there are two microbeams, in which one of them is at the vicinity of the wire and undergoes the mechanical vibrations due to the magnetic force between the wire and the microbeam. The movement of the microbeam while it is generating a magnetic field induces a current inside another microbeam, which is stationary, as the output signal of the current sensor. In the second configuration, a single composite piezoelectric microbeam is used. The magnetic force between the wire and the piezoelectric microbeam leads the piezoelectric microbeam to move, thus it produces a voltage. Both configurations present extremely low power consumption, which is not dependent on the sensitivity of the current sensors. The dynamic response, sensitivity and power consumption of the current sensors are investigated, compared and discussed.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da256e2fcf91f0012203df4/,301,https://engrxiv.org/uz85j/,10.31224/osf.io/uz85j,,2019-10-13T00:10:41.881871,2019-10-13T00:11:02.049678

Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanotubes have shown great potential as ideal and powerful photocatalysts in purification of polluted water due to their high photo oxidation, anti-fogging, nontoxicity, good chemical stability and low cost. Therefore, TiO2 nanotube arrays were fabricated by two-step anodization process at 30,40 and 50V; and were used in photocatalytic degradation of organic pollution p-nitrophenol. In order to have the crystal structure, nanotubes were annealed at 450 °C for 2 hours. Characterizing of TiO2 nanotubes were evaluated by FESEM, XRD and Spectrophotometry analyses. Effect of anodization voltage on nanotube’s length and diameter were investigated. The result showed that as anodization voltage increases from 30V to 50V, nanotube’s length, diameter and wall thickness increase linearly from 1.4 μm to 4.8 μm, 45 nm to 100nm and 15nm to 25 nm, respectively. Increasing in anodization voltage lead to enhancement in porosity (0.4-0.5) and roughness factor (109-194) of TiO2 nanotubes, respectively. By investigating kinetic of degradation of p-nitrophenol, it was observed that mechanism of photocatalytic degradation for all samples are followed first order kinetic. The results indicate that amongst all synthesized samples, 50 V sample with 38%, shows the most efficiency in degradation of p-nitrophenol under UV irradiation.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da0c319a7bc73000bea7f22/,267,https://engrxiv.org/8knwq/,10.31224/osf.io/8knwq,,2019-10-12T00:00:28.954514,2019-10-12T00:00:46.521015

We investigate if a laminar flow acts as a global attractor in 2D for large Reynolds number, or do other stable states exist. Since in case of channel flows, the laminar flow seems to be a global attractor, the question is if shear flows themselves show such behavior in curved geometries. While working, another interesting physical observation was made about the non-monotonic relaxation to the laminar flow: Starting from values significantly higher than laminar, the total kinetic energy decreases to a lesser value and then grows back to give the laminar flow. This phenomenon is studied in some detail and a possible reason for this is then examined. The work also investigates
the creation and destruction of vortices inside the domain and draws observations based on the sign of the vortices relative to the vorticity of the laminar flow. Since the creation and subsequent death of turbulence is a very interesting observation and can only be seen in 2D, it is studied extensively.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d9e2688f6b03e000f1ca935/,346,https://engrxiv.org/9w84y/,10.31224/osf.io/9w84y,,2019-10-10T11:02:59.793052,2019-10-10T11:11:04.323783

The sensitivity of porosity to foaming time and foaming temperature is measured. Also, the microstructure of the PMMA nanofoams is characterized in terms of cell size and cell nucleation density. A one-dimensional numerical model is developed to predict the growth of spherical, gas-filled voids during the solid-state foaming process. Diffusion of CO2 within the PMMA matrix is sufficiently rapid for the concentration of CO2 to remain almost uniform spatially. The foaming model makes use of experimentally calibrated constitutive laws for the uniaxial stress versus strain response of the PMMA grades as a function of strain rate and temperature, and the effect of dissolved CO2 is accounted for by a shift in the glass transition temperature of the PMMA.

e5wn3,"Damage assessment of CNT-doped composites through IR-thermography and electrical resistance measurement","Rooted in their heterogeneous microstructure, composite materials possess high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios, making them essential building blocks for a wide range of industrial applications. However, their complicated microstructure makes it difficult to predict the failure mechanism and residual life under varying external loads. The in-situ health monitoring system has received much attention in recent years as one of the promising solutions for the aforementioned limitations of composite material. In this research, we suggest a coupled health monitoring system where IR thermography and electrical resistance measurement are utilized simultaneously to diagnose the damage state of the composite materials during tensile testing. The deformation and failure timeline of GFRP under quasi-static tensile loading could be subdivided into three characteristic regions, here named as damage levels, characterized by i) elastic deformation without damage formation, ii) formation of distributed micro-damages, and iii) enlargement of concentrated damage. By employing a multiphysics simulation framework, we modeled the interplay between physical phenomena occurring in three damage stages, involving crack propagation, variation in the temperature profile and electrical resistance. The results also allowed us to have an estimation of the ‘damage stress(σD)’, a value that represents the onset of micro-damage, which has a negligible effect on the elastic properties, but might be dangerous under cyclic loading.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d98b6720a0361000c0ce122/,365,https://engrxiv.org/e5wn3/,10.31224/osf.io/e5wn3,,2019-10-06T00:48:52.986765,2019-10-06T00:49:23.102452

As a result, corrupted packets are a common case in wireless data transmissions. Many techniques have been proposed to tackle these issues and one of the recommended techniques is the partial packet recovery (PPR) scheme. There are various existing PPR methods that have been proposed, in the last two decades, in wireless networks. In addition, recent works have shown the possibility of network coding along with its capabilities in recovering the partial packets. This paper presents a review study of PPR approaches in wireless networks. We classify the approaches into several groups based on the soft information in the PHY layer.

gmzn5,"Algorithmic-Information Theory interpretation to the Traveling Salesman Problem","The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a important optimization problem in computer science, mathematics and logistics. It belongs to the class of NP-Hard problems and can be very time consuming to find solutions to large instances with guarantee optimality. As number of city-nodes in the graph increases, the amount of valid route tours also growths rapidly and thus requiring considerable time to evaluate and classify each permutation. The objective of the heuristic process is to search the solution space for the optimal solution while maximizing the attached utility-cost function (i.e. finding the shortest euclidean distance tour) and minimizing the computational time complexity of the algorithm.
Many complex real world scenarios can be reduced to a simulation of a salesman trying to find the shortest (length) Hamiltonian (cycle) route in a euclidean super-graph G*. If each city-node is modeled as a input symbol in a communication channel represented by an output pair with consistent probabilities distribution thus an polynomial-time probabilistic algorithm can use this information to improve the solution quality at the same rate of transmission of information over the channel.
In this paper we explore an quantitative stochastic process based in Algorithm Information Theory and the Shannon-Kelly criterion to find valid near optimal solutions using a new growth- optimal strategy applied to the TSP problem that have statistically significant transmission rate even when no encoding scheme is available, regardless of time-complexity of the problem.
Previous heuristics such as 2 opt, Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Simulated Annealing (SA) approach’s the TSP problem by relying on a priori knowledge about the data distribution in order to reduce the probability of error in finding the best candidate solution tour.
In this work we propose a method that models the solution space boundaries of the TSP problem as a communication channel by means of Information Theory. We describe a search algorithm that check for patterns (i.e information content) in the elements of a constrained solution space modeled as messages transmitted through communication systems. The boundaries of the search space are defined by the Kolmogorov complexity of the candidate solutions sequences.

In this regard, providing end users with detailed information about their consumption patterns is key in order to enable them to make informed decisions to reduce or adapt their energy consumption. This requires the deployment of feedback interactive technologies such as in-home displays, dedicated apps/web portals, or ambient interfaces. There have been extensive research and numerous pilot experiences on the effect of these technologies on end-user behavior, which identified the importance of an appropriate device design to achieve the desired demand response. However, a clear framework to design these feedback technologies in order to ensure the desired behavioral change does not exist. 
In order to fill this gap, this paper presents an exhaustive review of existing research on feedback, focusing especially on interactive devices. This review has resulted in the identification of ten key parameters that should be taken into account by device designers, including the type and form of the information provided (medium, units, disaggregation level, comparisons, goal setting), design of the interface and devices themselves, the possible inclusion of penalties and rewards, and privacy concerns. Recommendations to implement them in such a way that end-user interaction and response is maximized are provided. These recommendations would jointly make in-home displays more effective in creating the desired household behavioral change to maximize energy conservation.

863un,"Short and Spaced Twisted Tapes to Mitigate Fouling in Tubular Membranes","Static mixers are an efficient means to mitigate membrane fouling as they deflect the fluid, thus increasing the shear rate at the membrane surface and enhancing back-transport of rejected matter. However, inserting static mixers in the flow channel of a membrane imposes an additional pressure drop. To decrease this detrimental effect of static mixers, we shorten twisted tape mixers and investigate how this shortening translates into a reduction of fouling mitigation. We follow two approaches known from heat transfer enhancement: i) shorten the total length of the twisted tape and ii) use regularly spaced short twisted tape elements which are kept at their position by smooth rods placed in between the twisted elements. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is applied to analyze the flow pattern, the shear rate at the membrane and the resulting pressure drop. The results allow for the selection of modified twisted tape mixers with lower pressure loss, but sufficient flow properties for fouling mitigation. The most promising mixer designs were selected according to the CFD study, 3D-printed, and their fouling mitigation effect experimentally investigated using silica suspensions. Additionally, the effect of foulant concentration in this system is analyzed. For low silica concentrations (0.03 g/L) the short and spaced twisted tapes mitigate fouling as efficiently as the full-length twisted tape. At high silica concentrations and fluxes, the full-length mixer mitigates fouling more strongly than the short and spaced twisted tapes. However, the modified twisted tapes prove to be more energy-efficient up to a certain fouling exposure.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d8b2c90b3c37400189e8d1f/,274,https://engrxiv.org/863un/,10.31224/osf.io/863un,10.1016/j.memsci.2019.117426,2019-09-25T13:38:40.713757,2019-09-25T13:39:05.576671

Techniques which may allow Neptune aerocapture to be performed using heritage low-L/D blunt-body aeroshells are investigated, and obviate the need for mid-L/D aeroshells. A navigation study is performed to quantify the delivery errors, and a new guidance algorithm with on-board density estimation is developed to accommodate atmospheric uncertainties.

Existing approaches to MS implicitly/explicitly suppose that map segments have a certain size, or individual map segments are balanced in size. However, recent VPR systems showed that very small important map segments (minimal map segments) often suffice for VPC, and the remaining large unimportant portion of the map should be discarded to minimize map maintenance cost. Here, a new MS algorithm that can mine minimal map segments from  a large view-sequence map is presented. To solve the inherently NP hard problem, MS is formulated as a video-segmentation problem and the efficient point-trajectory based paradigm of video segmentation is used. The proposed map representation was implemented with three types of VPC: deep convolutional neural network, bag-of-words, and object class detector, and each was integrated  into a Monte Carlo localization algorithm (MCL) within a topometric VPR framework. Experiments using the publicly available NCLT dataset thoroughly investigate the efficacy of MS in terms of VPR performance.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d843096305a6800170b27cf/,255,https://engrxiv.org/v74eq/,10.31224/osf.io/v74eq,,2019-09-20T02:52:22.831419,2019-09-20T02:52:43.083963
qhgcx,"Fault-Diagnosing SLAM for Varying Scale Change Detection","In this paper, we present a new fault diagnosis (FD) -based approach for detection of imagery changes that can detect significant changes as inconsistencies between different sub-modules (e.g., self-localization) of visual SLAM. Unlike classical change detection approaches such as pairwise image comparison (PC) and anomaly detection (AD), neither the memorization of each map image nor the maintenance of up-to-date place-specific anomaly detectors are required in this FD approach. A significant challenge that is encountered when incorporating different SLAM sub-modules into FD involves dealing with the varying scales of objects that have changed (e.g., the appearance of small dangerous obstacles on the floor). To address this issue, we reconsider the bag-of-words (BoW) image representation, by exploiting its recent advances in terms of self-localization and change detection. As a key advantage, BoW image representation can be reorganized into any different scaling by simply cropping the original BoW image. Furthermore, we propose to combine different self-localization modules with strong and weak BoW features with different discriminativity, and to treat inconsistency between strong and weak self-localization as an indicator of change. The efficacy of the proposed approach of FD with/without combining AD and/or PC was experimentally validated.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d84260b305a6800160b8fae/,333,https://engrxiv.org/qhgcx/,10.31224/osf.io/qhgcx,,2019-09-20T02:50:44.368395,2019-09-20T02:51:02.809389

If  the number of requests more than the number of resources available at the service center can result in non-fulfillment of service requests, this can lead to a long queue of service requests, and if the demand for health care comes from an emergency patient (prioritized patient) can definitely cause this problem to die need to be handled better so as not to cause harm to service providers and patients as service recipients.  Health service requests by patients that provide information about the location and type of service desired will be received by the service provider / server connected to the internet service, so that health care request information can be scheduled by the server (hospital health). Communication between the resources available on the server allocates time for each health service that maximizes the limited use of resources to meet the patient's health service needs. The purpose of this study is to simulate the Smart Health model on health services using linear integer programming, so that the resulting model can solve the problem of limited available resources that can serve all requests so that services and services can be done quickly, so as to reduce the risk of losing lives or risks that can endanger the patient. From the new models produced, this maximizes health services and minimizes the time of arrival of medical personnel at the place of request, where when patients request treatment for medical care from the hospital, health care will be provided according to the patient's request.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d8414bd51eeee0019ba7d9e/,305,https://engrxiv.org/u945r/,10.31224/osf.io/u945r,,2019-09-20T02:48:31.485264,2019-09-20T02:48:43.095246
3smqp,"Voltage dip diagnosis in electrical distribution systems using extreme learning machines: an empirical evaluation","An inefficient operation of the utility grid can be inferred from low power quality indexes. Under such conditions, reductions in the useful life of equipments and loads, grid instabilities, service interruptions and breakdowns can be expected, which would produce meaningful economic losses for the end-users as well as for the power supply company. In this context, it is useful to have a diagnosis tool able to identify the underlying cause of a given disturbance. This article proposes a one-step extreme learning machine-based method for the diagnosis of voltage dips detected on an electrical distribution grid. The proposed method was evaluated on the basis of synthetic data generated by the simulation of a real power grid. The performance of 10 hyperparameter combinations on the diagnosis of 20 different classes of voltage dips was assessed through two different strategies, i.e.: 1) a one-for-all approach, with a common classifier for all disturbance classes; and 2) a one-against-all approach, with a classifier per disturbance class. It was proven that strategy 2) has a better generalization ability and lower training and testing times. The obtained results suggest the potential of the proposed approach for power quality disturbance diagnosis, and open the challenge of formulating further hypotheses to be assessed.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d82aaf5b3714e001886c68c/,543,https://engrxiv.org/3smqp/,10.31224/osf.io/3smqp,,2019-09-19T19:32:57.982801,2019-09-19T19:33:22.537079
nyqug,"Effective Plans for Hospital System Response to Earthquake Emergencies","Hospital systems play a critical role in treating injuries and preventing additional deaths during disaster emergency response. Natural disasters hinder the ability of hospital systems to operate at full capacity. Therefore, it is important for cities to develop policies and standards that enable hospitals' continuous operations to provide patients with timely treatment and ensure urban resilience. Here, we present a methodology to evaluate emergency response based on a probabilistic model that assesses the loss of hospital functions and quantifies multiseverity injuries as a result of earthquake damage. The proposed methodology is able to design effective plans for patient transferal and allocation of medical resources using an optimization formulation. This methodology is applied to Lima, Peru, subjected to a disaster scenario based on the M 8.0 earthquake that occurred there in 1940. Our results show that the spatial distribution of health service demands mismatches the post-earthquake capacities of hospitals, leaving large zones on the periphery of Lima significantly underserved. This study demonstrates how emergency plans that leverage hospital-system coordination can address this demand-capacity mismatch, enabling effective patient transfers, ambulance usage, and deployment of emergency medical teams.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d8286aeb3714e001986ac60/,428,https://engrxiv.org/nyqug/,10.31224/osf.io/nyqug,,2019-09-19T19:30:25.980391,2019-09-19T19:30:44.522162

Therefore, identification and differentiation of transient phenomena of power transformers, including internal and external errors and magnetic inrush current are essential. In this research, Clarke transform and S transform were used to distinguish between these phenomena that the proposed algorithm is very suitable in terms of three characteristics of accuracy, speed and computational cost. Initially, the simulation of internal, external errors and magnetic inrush current of the transformer was performed for different transformer scenarios. For this purpose, 1060 signal tests were performed under different conditions. Subsequently, the signals of differential current obtained by Clarke transformation and S transformation were analyzed and appropriate criteria were extracted for detecting the current of internal errors from external errors and inrush current. The simulated internal and external errors include three- phase, three-phase to ground, two- phase, two- phase to ground and phase to ground error. Simulations were performed using PSCAD software and implementation of the proposed algorithm in MATLAB environment. The results of this study prevent the unwanted performance of differential protection to prevent undesirable electrifying.

The application to the CUDA architecture is delineated in formal architectural definitions. 
Keywords: CUDA architectures, superscalar, ILP, data prediction, sense sensitivity index. 

What:
Out of order processing in a pipeline, can be optimized with the sense-boarding processor. 
In this single to multi-core scalable architecture, the processor is thread-centric with sleeping and active threads. Sleeping threads have a sense() function associated with them. Unlike their human counterparts, snoring is a useful feature that helps keep sensitive threads awake and running. sense-boarding is a scheduling algorithm that tracks the sensitivity indices of threads to snoring and helps schedule threads with dependency relationships for out of order execution.
How:
sense boarding is a board based dependency for instruction-level parallelism in multi-thread vector processing in out of order single-core/multicore symmetries.
Inter thread dependencies of data are marked in a board data-structure by maps to define sensitivity and sense indices, sense functionality is useful in the case of dependencies, resource waiting and speculative execution or in data generation and prediction. sense determines the relationship in instruction-level parallelism, to sensitive out of order and data speculation.

Sensitive elements in the network are those that carry critical flows, where a flow is deemed critical to the extent that it satisfies critical demand.

kc8wf,"Commercial microwave links for urban drainage modelling: The effect of link characteristics and their position on runoff simulations","Commercial microwave links (CMLs), radio connections widely used in telecommunication networks, can provide path-integrated quantitative precipitation estimates (QPEs) which could complement traditional precipitation observations. This paper assesses the ability of individual CMLs to provide relevant QPEs for urban rainfall-runoff simulations and specifically investigates the influence of CML characteristics and position on the predicted runoff. The analysis is based on a 3-year-long experimental data set from a small (1.3 km2) urban catchment located in Prague, Czech Republic. QPEs from real world CMLs are used as inputs for urban rainfall-runoff predictions and subsequent modelling performance is assessed by comparing simulated runoffs with measured stormwater discharges. The results show that model performance is related to both the sensitivity of CML to rainfall and CML position. The bias propagated into the runoff predictions is inversely proportional to CML path length. The effect of CML position is especially pronounced during heavy rainfalls, when QPEs from shorter CMLs, located within or close to catchment boundaries, better reproduce runoff dynamics than QPEs from longer CMLs extending far beyond the catchment boundaries. Interestingly, QPEs averaged from all available CMLs best reproduce the runoff temporal dynamics. Adjusting CML QPEs to three rain gauges located 2-3 km outside of the catchment substantially reduces the bias in CML QPEs. Unfortunately, this compromises the ability of the CML QPEs to reproduce runoff dynamics during heavy rainfalls. More experimental case studies are necessary to provide specific recommendations on CML preprocessing methods tailored to different water management tasks, catchments and CML networks.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d6f6cf980f9b5001964387b/,382,https://engrxiv.org/kc8wf/,10.31224/osf.io/kc8wf,10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.109522,2019-09-04T13:38:29.492634,2019-09-23T10:01:32.710248
5wz7d,"Correlation Transformational operators in Reactive Streams.","Abstract:
This paper describes two operators, autocorrelation and with transformational A.I for an event and sensor streams in reactive object-oriented programming.
The use of stream-beans and event-beans with multi-sensor integration with application in robotics is illustrated, with use in SLAM and other semantic transfer functions with cloud integration.

Keywords: Correlation operators, transformational A.I, Reactive Programming, Correlation operators, EJBs, automated persistence, RxJava, RxJS  

What: 
Reactive Programming provides for the application of operators through iterators and the observer pattern on streams. In a previous paper (Bheemaiah 2019) we have extended automated persistence of java beans as EJBs to reactive programming, with the addition of event-beans and stream-beans, we now extend the iterator methods on these beans with cross-correlation and auto-correlation functions.
We illustrate this with SLAM algorithms with correlation transformational A.I. We extend the SLAM algorithms to auditory localization.
How:
 We define a transformational A.I based system of correlation algorithms for application to stream beans and event beans.
We define its functionality in SLAM and in audio stream based localization of audio sources, both with or without echos.
Why:
Simultaneous localization and mapping can be achieved through both visual and auditory mechanisms. Localization is traditionally implied to mean the localization in absolute or relative coordinates with the creation of mapping and the additional determination of the pose of a camera for sensory input or a similar auditory localization as a pose in the case of lidar or ultrasound or audible range sound.

The one might want to know the forces and torques required to move a limb from an initial position to the desired destination position. Inverse dynamics is a helpful method to compute the force and torques for an articulated body limb. It enables us to know the joint torques required to rotate a link between two positions. Our goal in this study was to control a human-like articulated manipulator for a specific task of path tracking. For this purpose, the human arm was modeled with a three-link planar manipulator activated by Hill muscle model. Applying a proportional controller, values of force and torques applied to the joints were calculated by inverse dynamics and then joints and muscle forces trajectories were computed and presented. To be more accurate to say, the kinematics of the muscle-joint space was formulated by which we defined the relationship between the muscle lengths and the geometry of the links and joints. Secondary, the kinematic of the links was introduced to calculate the position of the end-effector in terms of the geometry. Then, we considered the modeling of Hill muscle dynamics and after calculation of joint torques, finally, we applied them to the dynamics of the three-link manipulator obtained from the inverse dynamics to calculate the joint states, find and control the location of manipulator’s end-effector.   The results show that the human arm model was successfully controlled to take the designated path of an ellipse precisely.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d67ef4072151000179b1513/,160,https://engrxiv.org/ckuh8/,10.31224/osf.io/ckuh8,,2019-08-29T15:59:18.891395,2019-12-19T04:10:00.377252

The plates have a symmetric lay-up and obey the geometrically non-linear von Karman law. A point-wise relation between the lamination parameters of the stiffest composite plates in postbuckling is derived and analyzed. It is shown that in the considered case not all lamination parameters are independent on each other (one of them is a linearly dependent one). The remaining linearly independent seven components of the lamination parameter vector are some non-linear functions of six parameters describing point-wisely the 2D principal strains and the principal curvatures.

wq932,"Design of the Energy Storages for a (Battery) Electric Commuter Train","The use of battery-powered electric commuter trains instead of those which are propelled by internal combustion engines on only partially (or non) electrified railway lines can save considerable amounts of energy and can avoid exhaust emissions to a large extent with comparatively low investment costs. As path to these goals, the railway line, the operating and the trains are modeled for a particularly interesting, real-life example. Then, for the generated models, it is shown how the energy demands of model-compliant (battery) electric commuter trains can be calculated and how their energy storages can be designed. The models and the procedure can also be applied for a large number of comparable dimensioning cases when defining further railway lines, operating and commuter train models, corresponding parameterization as well as the occasionally necessary addition of slope and curvature resistances. The calculation of energy demands and the design of energy storages, however, show that there are a large number of different alternatives for technical specifications as well as decisions relevant to energy efficiency and business management, too.

Additive Manufacturing has garnered significant interest from a wide range of industries, academia and government stakeholders due to its potential to reform and disrupt traditional manufacturing processes. The technology offers unprecedented design freedom and customization along with its ability to process novel and high

To harness the maximum potential of this technology, designers are often tasked with creating new products or re-design existing portfolios of traditionally manufactured parts to achieve lightweight designs with better performance. To date, few studies explore the correspondence between design behaviors and manufacturability of final product within an Additive Manufacturing context. This paper presents empirical data from the design processes of six graduate student engineering designers as they re-design a traditionally designed part for additive manufacturing.

c7hsj,"Perfusion 3D Bioprinting with Gelatin and Hydrogel for Vascular Tissue Engineering","Vascular disease is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in developed countries, and thereby necessitates the replacement of diseased artery or vein through surgical intervention. Tissue engineering offers an alternative approach of designing biomaterials for small diameter artery regeneration.

Vascular graft infections occur infrequently, with an incidence that varies by surgical site but in general ranges from 0.5% to 6%. Infections of vascular grafts are associated with significant mortality and morbidity risk. Vascularization is also a major problem in tissue engineering, especially for engineering tissues that are thicker than approximately 200 μm. Insufficient vascularization limits the oxygen and nutrient transfer to cells, which can lead to hypoxia and formation of non-uniform tissue structures. Vasculature-like structures are usually multilayer and hollow. They have a complex shape with varying diameters throughout the body. Thus, it is quite difficult to imitate this complex 3D structure using materials similar to native vessels such as hydrogels. Though a few techniques have been explored to fabricate this complex 3D structure, direct bioprinting of such a complex 3D structure on a solid platform in a single step has not been realized.

Natural vascular tissues serve as a unique experimental tool for investigating fundamental mechanisms of vascular function and maturation process under 3D flow conditions.

hsjme,"Modeling Hydrogen Networks for Future Energy Systems: A Comparison of Linear and Nonlinear Approaches","Common energy system models that integrate hydrogen transport in pipelines typically simplify fluid flow models and reduce the network size in order to achieve solutions quickly. This contribution analyzes two different types of pipeline network topologies (namely, star and tree networks) and two different fluid flow models (linear and nonlinear) for a given hydrogen capacity scenario of electrical reconversion in Germany to analyze the impact of these simplifications. For each network topology, robust demand and supply scenarios are generated. The results show that a simplified topology, as well as the consideration of detailed fluid flow, could heavily influence the total pipeline investment costs. For the given capacity scenario, an overall cost reduction of the pipeline costs of 37% is observed for the star network with linear cost compared to the tree network with nonlinear fluid flow. The impact of these improvements regarding the total electricity reconversion costs has led to a cost reduction of 1.4%, which is fairly small. Therefore, the integration of nonlinearities into energy system optimization models is not recommended due to their high computational burden. However, the applied method for generating robust demand and supply scenarios improved the credibility and robustness of the network topology, while the simplified fluid flow consideration can lead to infeasibilities. Thus, we suggest the utilization of the nonlinear model for post-processing to prove the feasibility of the results and strengthen their credibility, while retaining the computational performance of linear modeling.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d48412b90489f00194a3a35/,568,https://engrxiv.org/hsjme/,10.31224/osf.io/hsjme,,2019-08-06T15:41:02.936923,2019-08-06T15:41:21.985758

urxgs,"Updating Maxwell with Electrons and Charge Aug 2-1.pdf (Version: 1)","Maxwell's equations describe the relation of charge and electric force almost perfectly even though electrons and permanent charge were not in his equations, as he wrote them. For Maxwell, all charge depended on the electric field. Charge was induced and polarization was described by a single dielectric constant. Electrons, permanent charge, and polarization are important when matter is involved. Polarization of matter cannot be described by a single dielectric constant  ?_(r  )with reasonable realism today when applications involve 10^(-10)   sec. Only vacuum is well described by a single dielectric constant ?_(0 ). 
Here, Maxwell's equations are rewritten to include permanent charge and any type of polarization. Rewriting is in one sense petty, and in another sense profound, in either case presumptuous. Either petty or profound, rewriting confirms the legitimacy of electrodynamics that includes permanent charge and realistic polarization. One cannot be sure ahead of time that a theory of electrodynamics without electrons or (permanent, field independent) charge (like Maxwell's equations as he wrote them) would be legitimate or not. After all a theory cannot calculate the fields produced by charges (for example electrons) that are not in the theory at all!
After updating,
	Maxwell's equations seem universal and exact.
	Polarization must be described explicitly to use Maxwell's equations in applications.
	 Conservation of total current (including ?_0  ?E??t) becomes exact, independent of matter, allowing precise definition of electromotive force EMF in circuits.
	Kirchhoff's current law becomes as exact as Maxwell's equations themselves.
	Classical chemical kinetics is seen to need revision to conserve current.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d4594cb90489f001b4b6e58/,401,https://engrxiv.org/urxgs/,10.31224/osf.io/urxgs,,2019-08-03T19:38:06.507338,2019-08-29T15:56:46.314780

Results for film pressure and load-carrying capacity have been plotted and analyzed on the basis of numerical results. To take the effects of surface roughness into account, Christensen theory of rough surface has been adopted. The expression for pressure gradient has been derived by means of the energy integral approach. This approach avoids the derivation of Reynolds’ equation. The numerical results for film pressure and load capacity have been obtained using Mathematica. It was observed that in comparison with smooth surfaces, dimensionless film pressure and load capacity is lower for longitudinal roughness and higher for circular roughness patterns with and the variations are significant. Load carrying capacity decreases with the increase of longitudinal roughness and, increases with the increase of circular roughness.

t3d86,"High-Resolution One-Dimensional Modeling of a Gas Turbine Combustor Using Eulerian-Lagrangian Method","In this paper, a dynamic combustor model for inclusion into a one-dimensional full gas turbine engine simulation model, with high numerical accuracy is developed. Effects of dominant parameters, such as frequency and amplitude of the inlet air and fuel mass flow rate fluctuations, on outlet temperature of the combustion chamber, are investigated. The main goal of this research is to analyze the response of the gas turbine combustor to dynamic events that occur in the compressor. In the present work, for modeling combustion, the equations of chemical equilibrium (a second-law concept) are developed and applied to combustion-product mixtures. Thus the heat released from combustion is computed and used as a source term in the energy equation. Ignition effects either would be considered with a time lag equation as a source term in the energy equation. The combustor flammability limits are determined by using available experimental data for various gases and also Le Chatelier’s law. Source terms of governing equations are added using the operator splitting method. To operate this, the modified version of the PPM algorithm called PPMLR is used which solves the Euler equations in Lagrangian coordinates. At the end of each time step, results calculated in the Lagrangian coordinates would remap to the original Eulerian coordinate. The results revealed that to achieve a grid-independent solution, the accuracy of 0.002 m over the length of the combustion chamber should be applied. By reducing the accuracy of simulation, numerical diffusion causes a rise in flow temperature along with the combustion chamber. Through the dynamic modeling aspect, it is found that by increasing inlet fuel flow rate frequency up to 25 Hz, the amplitude of the fluctuations of outlet temperature, increases. Further increase in frequency up to 100 Hz, the amplitude of the fluctuations remains unchanged. However further increases in frequency from 100 Hz, causes amplitudes of outlet temperature fluctuations to decrease.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d3a965ea3c0020018854de1/,381,https://engrxiv.org/t3d86/,10.31224/osf.io/t3d86,,2019-07-27T23:04:30.687765,2020-08-04T13:25:15.238472

However, the mix design, which based on the compaction properties, remains largely on empirical data. We found difficulties to relate the aggregate size distribution and the asphalt binder properties to the compaction behavior in both the field and laboratory compaction of asphalt mixtures. In this paper, we would like to propose a simple hybrid model to predict the compaction of asphalt mixtures. In this model, we divided the compaction process into two mechanisms: (i) visco-plastic deformation of an ordered thickly-coated granular assembly, and (ii) the transition from an ordered system to a disordered system due to particle rearrangement. This model could take into account both the viscous properties of the asphalt binder and grain size distributions of the aggregates. Additionally, we suggest to use the discrete element method to understand the particle rearrangement during the compaction process. This model is calibrated based on the SuperPave gyratory compaction tests in the pavement lab.

Obtaining distribution of Mach number along diffuser length, changes in other main characteristics of flow such as pressure, temperature, speed, and density for all of the points along diffuser length would be obtained. In order to verify the validity of the numerical algorithm used, the gas flow would be solved in a divergent nozzle and compared to other numerical methods.

Some useful energy relations are established. It is also demonstrated that the total complementary energy may be considered as a measure of the compliance for the post-buckled composite plate. The latter measure leads to the same lay-up optimality conditions as obtained earlier via the maximization of the total potential energy. Basing on the complementary variational principle, a monotonic plate compliance minimization approach is proposed. The approach allows determining the stiffest lay-up.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2c1607114a42001608ee8a/,365,https://engrxiv.org/3vbj6/,10.31224/osf.io/3vbj6,,2019-07-15T17:54:57.927848,2020-08-04T13:07:54.784339
5q4pf,"Smart Product Design for Automotive Systems","Automobiles evolved from primarily mechanical to electro-mechanical, or mechatronic, vehicles. For example, carburetors have been replaced by fuel injection and air-fuel ratio control, leading to order of magnitude improvements in fuel economy and emissions. Mechatronic systems are pervasive in modern automobiles and represent a synergistic integration of mechanics, electronics and computer science. They are smart systems, whose design is more challenging than the separate design of their mechanical, electronic and computer/control components.
In this review paper, two recent methods for the design of mechatronic components are summarized and their applications to problems in automotive control are highlighted. First, the combined design, or co-design, of a smart artifact and its controller is considered. It is shown
that the combined design of an artifact and its controller can lead to improved performance compared to sequential design. The coupling between the artifact and controller design problems is quantified, and methods for co-design are presented. The control proxy function method, which provides ease of design as in the sequential approach and approximates the performance of the co-design approach, is highlighted with application to the design of a passive/ active automotive suspension. Second, the design for component swapping modularity (CSM) of a distributed controller for a smart product is discussed. CSM is realized by employing distributed controllers residing in networked smart components, with bidirectional communication over the network. Approaches to CSM design are presented, as well as applications of the method to a variable-cam-timing engine, and to enable battery swapping in a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2b9b2fa26b3400190aab29/,409,https://engrxiv.org/5q4pf/,10.31224/osf.io/5q4pf,10.1007/s11465-019-0527-0,2019-07-15T17:52:44.411755,2019-07-15T17:53:03.518122

In this work, we investigate the convergence properties of the Virtual Crack Closure Technique (VCCT) when applied to the evaluation of the Mode I, Mode II and total Energy Release Rate of the fiber-matrix interface crack in the context of the Finite Element Method (FEM). We first propose a synthetic vectorial formulation of the VCCT. Thanks to this formulation, we study the convergence properties of the method, both analytically and numerically.

Debond growth is characterized by estimation of the Energy Release Rates (ERRs) in Mode I and Mode II using the Virtual Crack Closure Technique (VCCT) and the J-integral. It is found that increasing fiber content, a larger distance between debonds in the loading direction and the presence of a free surface close to the debond have all a strong enhancing effect on the ERR.

9y65h,"Dynamic transport mode estimation subject to joint decisions and spatio-temporal variations","This thesis studies the dynamic route and transport mode optimization for participating in a jointly decided activity subject to spatio-temporal variations. Joint activity participants have to travel from their current locations to a common location which is the location of the joint activity. Apart from the recurrent joint activities (such as work, school etc.), there are several joint leisure activities where activity participants have to decide about the location and the starting time of the joint leisure activity along with the transport mode(s) that each one of them has to use for commuting from his/her current location to the joint leisure activity location.

The objective of this thesis is the development of a comprehensive system for the optimization of joint leisure trips that are not related to work by optimizing (a) the location and the starting time of the joint leisure activity (b) the public transport operations (c) the transport mode(s) selection for each activity participant in order to arrive there as fast as possible while satisfying his/her personal trip preferences.

Activities not related to work can be responsible for more than 60\% of trips at an urban environment. Non-working travel patterns differ from the more stable, recurrent travel patterns of work-related activities such as trips from/to work, school etc. and the three main differences of those activities are: (1) The location of a leisure activity can differ on a daily basis (it is not static like the location of the working or studying place); (2) The starting time of a leisure activity has greater elasticity and can differ on a daily basis (it is not stable such as the starting time of work, school etc.); (3) The alternative journey options to and from a leisure activity location are not well-known to the users (users are more aware of their journey alternatives when it comes to transfers from/to work-related activities since those activities are re-current) .
 
Given that a significant number of transfers is related to leisure activities, the optimization of the (1) location selection, (2) starting activity time, (3) transport mode selection and (4) route selection are of paramount importance for both the commuters' total travel cost and the transport network performance. In addition, the prediction of non-recurrent activities in time and space can be an important step forward for the tactical and dynamic planning of transport networks since the volume and the non-recurrent nature of such activities lead to significant travel demand variations compared to the more stable, work-related activities. 

Due to the above, this thesis focuses on: (i) Understanding the State-of-the-Art (SoA) work on utilizing user-generated data for increasing the efficiency level of joint leisure activities and proposing actions towards this direction; (ii) Capturing users' willingness to travel certain distances for participating in different types of activities; (iii) Optimizing the selection of locations and starting times of joint leisure activities (iv) Re-scheduling the starting times of public transportation trips in order to adjust to the joint leisure activity demand without deteriorating the Quality of Service (QoS) for other passengers; (v) Optimizing the journey/path selection of users' who are willing to travel from one point of the network to another for participating at one activity and, possibly, utilize multiple modes while also satisfying their preferences.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d28b8cea26b3400190923f0/,669,https://engrxiv.org/9y65h/,10.31224/osf.io/9y65h,,2019-07-12T18:34:49.152836,2019-07-21T14:23:21.868892

6q4zj,"COMPOSITE PLATES AND THEIR LAY-UP SOLUTIONS LEADING TO HIGH BUCKLING AND POST-BUCKLING RESISTANCE","At the beginning of the present paper, the post-buckled composite plates are examined. The plates have a symmetric lay-up. The layer orientation angles vary in a point-wise way or in a plate-wise way. The von Karman theory describes a plate behavior. For a plate stiffness maximization problem the first-order optimality conditions are derived. In the conditions, the essential roles play the mid-plane principal strains and the principal curvatures. The optimality conditions may lead to a co-axiality of some structural tensors. Analytical examples illustrate the solutions of such types. Further, several numerical examples are presented. In the examples, the plates are loaded by shear and have the high buckling-resisting ability also. A significant conclusion of the paper is that in the properly designed lay-up the outermost layers and the innermost layers play different roles. The former ones withstand mainly buckling, and the latter ones withstand mainly post-buckling. The innermost layers have the orientation angle rather close to 0°.

For cellular therapy applications, xeno‐free culture conditions are desirable to improve product safety and reduce process variability. We have previously described a novel fluorophore‐tagged RGD peptide (RGD‐TAMRA) that enhanced the adhesion of mature endothelial cells in vitro. To investigate whether this peptide can replace animal‐derived extracellular matrix proteins in the isolation and expansion of ECFCs, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 22 adult healthy adult donors were seeded on RGD‐TAMRA‐modified polystyrene culture surfaces. Endothelial colony formation was significantly enhanced on RGD‐TAMRA‐modified surfaces compared to the unmodified control. No phenotypic differences were detected between ECFCs obtained on RGD‐TAMRA compared to ECFCs obtained on rat tail collagen‐coated surfaces. Compared to collagen‐coated surfaces and unmodified surfaces, RGD‐TAMRA surfaces promoted ECFC adhesion, cell spreading, and clonal expansion.

te5jx,"Atomization and combustion characteristics of a fuel–water rapid internal mixing injector","In this study, we investigated the atomization characteristics of rapid internal mixing injector (RIM injector) developed in our laboratory. RIM injector successfully emulsifies base fuel without any surfactant just before fuel injection. The diameter of droplet discharged from RIM injector was evaluated based on processing of shadowgraph images. It was found that Sauter mean diameter (SMD) of droplet is determined by the gas to liquid ratio (GLR) and viscosity of emulsified fuel. The increasing GLR decreases SMD value. As water content ratio is increased, the inner structure of droplet changes to W/O type emulsion. The emulsification increases its viscosity, which deteriorates the atomization characteristics. We proposed an empirical formula as functions of GLR and Reynolds number reproducing the deterioration resulting from increasing viscosity. The formula successfully predicts the SMD variation with respect to GLR and water content ratio. Finally, we examined the effect of atomization air ratio on NOx and PM emissions. The quantity of atomization air significantly influences the PM emission because the increasing air improves the mixing of fuel vapor with combustion air.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d257502114a42001802b5a6/,325,https://engrxiv.org/te5jx/,10.31224/osf.io/te5jx,,2019-07-10T20:34:34.451353,2020-07-26T15:32:33.042930

rcw3e,"Large-amplitude Dithering Mitigates Glitches in Digital-to-analogue Converters","This paper develops and experimentally evaluates a dither-based method for improved generation of arbitrary signals in digital-to-analogue converters that exhibits glitches --- essentially converting the glitches from high-frequency to low-frequency disturbances. One major benefit of this behaviour appears in closed-loop control applications, as the glitch disturbance can be moved from outside control law bandwidth to inside control law bandwidth, enabling suppression by feedback. A behavioural model of glitches is presented and the effect of applying a dither signal is analysed in detail. Analytical and experimental results demonstrate that a dither signal with sufficiently large amplitude can mitigate the effect of glitches, when used in conjunction with a low-pass filter. Severe glitches appear in various digital-to-analogue converter topologies, including converter topologies that are used in high-precision motion control applications, such as adaptive optics and scanning force microscopy. Glitches introduce impulse-like disturbances which have a broadband frequency distribution. Low-pass filtering alone does not provide sufficient attenuation, and in applications with feedback control only frequency content within the control law bandwidth is attenuated. Hence, a high-frequency disturbance such as a glitch will not be suppressed. The use of dithering to suppress glitches is therefore beneficial in applications where errors in signal conversion are a primary concern, such as high-precision motion control or accurate reference signal generation.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d23a8a545253a001b39197c/,450,https://engrxiv.org/rcw3e/,10.31224/osf.io/rcw3e,10.1109/TSP.2020.2978626,2019-07-08T20:49:05.025343,2020-07-26T15:33:35.695980
5xktq,"Optimal Quantiser Performance with a Small Dither","A quantiser is a non-smooth function and no inverse function exist that can be applied to correct for the error it introduces. Applying a dither signal and averaging to a quantiser produces a smooth image for which an inverse function does exist. This article describes methods for minimising the error after inverse compensation. We show that there is an optimal dither variance that minimises the error after inversion. Simple rules for choosing the optimal dither variance are presented. The error after inversion can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the averaging length. This can be done by oversampling the signal by the same factor as the number of averages. Quantisation of a dither signal with a continuous probability distribution, produces a discrete probability mass function. We discuss a method for recovering an unknown continuous probability distribution from the empirical discrete probability mass function of the quantised dither signal. This enables inverse compensation in systems where exact control of the dither signal is not possible, as inverse compensation requires information about the continuous probability distribution of the dither signal and the step-size of the quantiser.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d239e58a26b340017057c40/,404,https://engrxiv.org/5xktq/,10.31224/osf.io/5xktq,,2019-07-08T20:04:49.470887,2020-07-26T15:33:44.931752

pfys6,"Collaborating with Style: Using an Agent-Based Model to Simulate Cognitive Style Diversity in Problem Solving Teams","Collaborative problem solving can be successful or counterproductive. The performance of collaborative teams depends not only on team members' abilities, but also on their cognitive styles. Cognitive style measures differences in problem-solving behavior: how people generate solutions, manage structure, and interact. While teamwork and problem solving have been studied separately, their interactions are less understood. This paper introduces the KAI Agent-Based Organizational Optimization Model (KABOOM), the first model to simulate cognitive style in collaborative problem solving. KABOOM simulates the performance of teams of agents with heterogeneous cognitive styles on two contextualized design problems. Results demonstrate that, depending on the problem, certain cognitive styles may be more effective than others. Also, intentionally aligning agents' cognitive styles with their roles can improve team performance.

Cognitive style plays an important role in how teams of engineers design and collaborate, but the interactions of cognitive style with team organization and processes have not been well studied. The limitations of small-scale behavioral experiments have led researchers to develop computational models for simulating teamwork; however, none have modeled the effects of individuals' cognitive styles.

In KABOOM, heterogeneous agents imitate the diverse problem-solving styles described by Kirton's Adaption-Innovation construct, which places each individual somewhere along the spectrum of cognitive style preference.

Upon activation of a resistive heater, a low-melting membrane (ParafilmTM) is removed to vent an entrapped gas pocket, thus letting the incoming liquid wet an intermediate dissolvable film and thus open the valve. The proposed system allows up to 12 heaters to be activated in parallel with a response time below 3 seconds, potentially, resulting in 128 actuated valves in under 30 seconds.

The recent crisis brought on by Cape Town’s “Day Zero” drought created the impetus to expand on existing research on water demand management to include analysis of school usage patterns and key determinants thereof. With the effects of apartheid still visible in society and in school infrastructure coupled with the high water usage rates at schools, this paper evaluates the impact of school affluence (whether it is fee-paying or not, and self-governing or not) on water usage. We find that poor schools use substantially more water, partially because of poor maintenance, with mean water efficiencies of poor schools around 50% and 80% for affluent schools. Bayesian models were used to further determine which characteristics of a school are good proxies for the higher usage to help administrators and policy makers in the resource constrained educational environment.

Many of these crashes could be avoided or made less severe with the aid of crash avoidance technologies. These technologies can assist the driver in maintaining control of the vehicle when a possibly dangerous situation arises by issuing alerts to the driver and in a few cases, responding to the situation itself. This paper estimates the societal and private benefits and costs associated with three crash avoidance technologies, blind-spot monitoring, lane departure warning, and forward-collision warning, for all light duty passenger vehicles in the U.S. for the year 2015. The three technologies could collectively prevent up to 1.6 million crashes each year including 7,200 fatal crashes. In this paper, the authors estimated the net-societal benefits to the overall society from avoiding the cost of the crashes while also estimating the private share of those benefits that are directly affecting the crash victims.

If the risk is below the security risk appetite of the manufacturing system, it could be accepted. However, if it is above the risk appetite, the system should appropriately respond by either avoiding, transferring, or mitigating the risk. The validation of the risk in terms of severity and likelihood of the threat, however, is challenging because the later component is hard to quantify. In this paper, Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) method is modified by employing game theory to quantitatively assess the likelihood of cyber-physical security risks. This method utilizes the game theory approach by modeling the rivalry between the attacker and the system as a game and then try to analyze it to find the likelihood of the attacker’s action. We first define players of the game, action sets, and the utility function.  Major concerns of cyber security issues in the manufacturing area are carefully considered in defining the cost function composed of defense policy, loss in production, and recovery. A linear optimization model is utilized to find a mixed-strategy Nash Equilibrium, which is the probability of choosing any action by the attacker also known as the likelihood of an attack. Numerical experiments are presented to further illustrate the method. Forecasting the attacker’s behavior enables us to assess the cybersecurity risk in a manufacturing system and thereby be more prepared with plans of proper responses.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d1696ec8a17d5001604edd6/,525,https://engrxiv.org/mb5t9/,10.31224/osf.io/mb5t9,,2019-06-29T00:05:34.970605,2020-07-20T19:41:10.612143

There are four main hardware components commonly implemented in these devices that can be tuned to achieve desired performance: motor, reduction ratio N, series spring stiffness Ks, and parallel spring stiffness Kp. The allowed joint range of motion is a fifth parameter that can also drastically change energy consumption. We apply a kinematically clamped analysis to the system equations to map the electric cost of transport (COT) for knee and ankle level-ground walking, in addition to ankle stair ascent and descent. We also utilize an optimization procedure to identify minimum energy hardware configurations. The energy map provides insight into consequences of variance from optimal parameters. Our results support the contribution of the series elastic element for improved power output. Parallel stiffness can provide up to 8% improvements in walking with minimal negative effect with varied terrain, and a varying ankle transmission ratio can similarly improve COT by 8% from level-ground to stair ascent. Limited dorsiflexion can further improve COT by 30%.

Van der Waals interactions between the nanotubes often result in formation of nanotube bundles and/or ropes. Determination of mechanical properties of the nanobundle- and nanorope-based nanocomposites is difficult due to the complicated geometries of the reinforcement structures. However, in order to better utilize nanocomposites, it is crucial to determine mechanical properties of nanocomposites in their real form as much as possible. In this paper, the elasticity theory for anisotropic body and continuum modeling are used to determine effective mechanical properties of bundle and nanorope-based nanocomposites. Numerical models are developed using a Representative Volume Element (RVE) consisting of nanoropes and nanobundles made up of different numbers of nanotubes to investigate the effect of nanorope geometry on nanocomposite mechanical properties. Models of several RVEs are developed with nanoropes consisting of five, seven, nine, and thirteen CNTs. CNT volume fraction is kept constant in all models for a valid comparison.

The details of device structure and design are presented as a reference for application of the methodology. By quantifying the average and local post-fluidization density of the bed, the performance of the fluidized bed device is characterized. With the addition of vibration and by changing the defluidization rate, the sand can be prepared with volume-based relative densities ranging from 10% to 92%. Local sand density, measured with a cone penetrometer, is nearly uniform across the bed: density variation is less than 13% (coefficient of variation with respect to relative density) for all protocols except for some beds prepared by defluidization only. The variation of local density and penetration resistance measured across the bed breadth is comparable to results from beds prepared by the commonly used method of pluviation.

This work seeks to identify market barriers and supports for the adoption of renewable energy. A framework to represent the evaluation process for generating capacity is proposed and applied to two regions: California (CAISO), where legislation requires most electricity to be supplied by renewables by 2030, and the Mid-Atlantic (PJM), where renewables have barely penetrated the market. Generation technologies are ordered via multiobjective optimization using genetic algorithms to resolve a bounded knapsack problem. Price factors for each technology are established.

3mpyt,"Application of background pressure with kinematic criterion for free surface extension to suppress non-physical voids in the finite volume particle method","Lagrangian particle methods such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and the finite volume particle method (FVPM) can suffer from non-physical voids in the spatial discretisation, due to the inability of numerical particles to deform as continuum fluid elements can. It is known that the situation can be improved for wall-bounded flows in SPH by adding a uniform background pressure to ensure positive absolute pressure everywhere. In this article, we investigate the application of background pressure in FVPM, and show that numerical voids grow under negative pressure and collapse under positive pressure. To use this technique in free-surface flow, however, the background pressure must be applied as an atmospheric pressure at the free surface. A kinematic criterion for free surface extension (KCFSE) to differentiate physical free surfaces from new numerical voids has been developed, supplementing the inherent capability of FVPM to identify free-surface particles robustly. The novel method enables background pressure to be applied at physical free surfaces and throughout the fluid, but not in non-physical voids, facilitating the suppression of such spurious voids. The KCFSE is validated for a translating square cylinder inside a rectangular numerical domain, with and without a free surface, and liquid in an oscillating rectangular tank.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d026121760f11001afbd862/,368,https://engrxiv.org/3mpyt/,10.31224/osf.io/3mpyt,10.1016/j.enganabound.2019.05.010,2019-06-13T17:56:22.461458,2019-06-13T17:56:48.954686
wekmq,"Design and Repeatability Analysis of Desktop Tool for Rapid Pre-Cracking of Notched Ductile Plastic Fracture Specimens","Fracture testing is a useful mechanical testing process to explore the properties and behavior of materials, one that has seen much development and refinement in recent decades. One of the most important steps in preparing samples for testing is the production of a sharp pre-crack to initiate crack propagation in a predictable way. While several methods have been developed for doing this, particularly for metals and brittle plastic materials, a quick and reliable method for more ductile materials is lacking. This technical note describes the design and verification of a simple desktop-sized pre-cracking device which safely uses a razor blade and hammer to quickly produce straight and sharp pre-cracks of consistent depth in ductile polymeric material samples. To verify its capability and consistency, a series of tests were performed using both molded and 3-D printed acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). First, a series of 40 notched 25 mm x 9.5 mm ABS bars were pre-cracked, and the distance under the crack measured on both sides of the bar. Several bars were then broken along the cracks to examine the quality of the pre-crack front. These tests were then repeated 20 times each for two print orientations of fused deposition modeling (FDM) ABS printed at 100% density. All 80 pre-cracks were found to be straight, sharp, and within 1% of the nominal distance under the crack for all samples. The consistency of the pre-cracks throughout the sample cross-section was also observed to be excellent, with all 80 tests showing less than 0.25 mm of deviation, even on the highly-anisotropic FDM samples.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d00a34a2a575b0017a08c38/,463,https://engrxiv.org/wekmq/,10.31224/osf.io/wekmq,,2019-06-12T21:20:12.253037,2019-06-12T21:20:41.637028

Both the formulations are embedded with a new cell transmission model that satisfies the link-level First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Because the formulations are node-based, the need for path enumeration is obviated, which results in considerable computational efficiency compared to the existing path-based models. While this advantage of node-based (or bush-based) models has been widely accepted in the literature of static traffic assignment, the formulations of dynamic traffic assignment models have mostly been path-based. The present work first describes a node-based cell transmission model that satisfies the link-level FIFO principle, which is fit within a DTA framework that facilitates efficient computation of UE and SO solutions. Further contributions of the work include the introduction of a backpropagation algorithm to efficiently compute marginal costs and complementarity formulations of the problems. Finally, numerical results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed models using two standard test networks, along with a discussion of their convergence.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d009249edaf2800199dd9fc/,363,https://engrxiv.org/85btc/,10.31224/osf.io/85btc,,2019-06-12T21:18:10.482875,2019-08-23T02:28:38.830308
bv6g4,"Sulfide and Fluoride Ions Based Passivation of GaAs(100) Surface and Concept of Combining Surface Passivation with Tunnel Junction Based Molecular Devices","Sulfur interaction with GaAs can reduce the harmful effect of surface states on recombination attributes. Apart from surface passivation, study of sulfur bonding on GaAs is also important for developing novel molecular electronics and molecular spintronics devices, where a molecular channel can be connected to at least one GaAs surface via thiol functional group. Excess thiol functional groups that are not involved in making molecular device channels can serve as the passivants to quench surface states. However, the primary challenge lies in increasing the stability and effectiveness of the sulfur passivated GaAs. We have investigated the effect of single and double step surface passivation of n-GaAs(100) by using the sulfide and fluoride ions. Our single-step passivation involved the use of sulfide and fluoride ions individually. However, the two kinds of double-step passivations were performed by treating the n-GaAs surface. In the first approach GaAs surface was firstly treated with sulfide ions and secondly with fluoride ions, respectively. In the second double step approach GaAs surface was first treated with fluoride ions followed by sulfide ions, respectively. Sulfidation was conducted using the nonaqueous solution of sodium sulfide salt. Whereas the passivation steps with fluoride ion was performed with the aqueous solution of ammonium fluoride. Both sulfidation and fluoridation steps were performed either by dipping the GaAs sample in the desired ionic solution or electrochemically. Photoluminescence was conducted to characterize the relative changes in surface recombination velocity due to the single and double step surface passivation. Photoluminescence study showed that the double-step chemical treatment where GaAs was first treated with fluoride ions followed by the sulfide ions yielded the highest improvement. The time vs. photoluminescence study showed that this double-step passivation exhibited lower degradation rate as compared to widely discussed sulfide ion passivated GaAs surface. We also conducted surface elemental analysis using Rutherford Back Scattering to decipher the near surface chemical changes due to the four passivation methodologies we adopted. The double-step passivations affected the shallower region near GaAs surface as compared to the single step passivations.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d0053392a575b00169f8172/,342,https://engrxiv.org/bv6g4/,10.31224/osf.io/bv6g4,10.1557/adv.2017.380,2019-06-12T02:45:21.861469,2019-06-12T02:45:41.331085

We are especially interested in distributed implementations which have low communication overhead and low processing complexity.   Row constraints are known to be sufficient, and we introduce the notion of the induced star number of a graph and show that this quantity determines the performance of this condition.  We further investigate this problem for some special classes of networks and interference models such as unit disk networks and primary interference constraints.

This is due to the factor of noise measurement and number of particle. Usually, the special strategies resampling algorithms was used. However, these algorithms just can fit in certain environment.

One of technology application is in the learning and education process. Adaptive Navigation Support (ANS) is a method and part of a hypermedia study that can boost the performance of students by using the benefit of technology. With ANS, students are able to make the learning process more interesting as the learning material relatively corresponds to their knowledge and preferences. Furthermore, ANS can guide students in finding their paths and ways in hyperspace based on student requirements, goals, and characteristics. Therefore, ANS has caught many researchers attention in their studies to improve student skills and performance in the learning process. Many papers, discussed in ANS, have been published over the last decade, however, no one has studied the ANS in a comprehensive way. This paper is a literature review in ANS and its application as well as its implication in the learning process. There are fourty-nine papers as its source of analysis. Our findings show that the applications of ANS can be classified into four dimensions, such as platform, use case, impact, and process.

7s5qu,"Detailed Balance Analysis of Photovoltaic Windows","There are a number of technical and socio-economic factors converging to position photovoltaic (PV) windows as a transformative technology for the energy landscape of the future: 1) Urban areas currently account for 67–76% of global final energy consumption. 2) 70% of the world’s population will live in urban areas by 2050. 3) The overwhelming architectural trend is away from opaque building components and toward all-glass facades. 4) Photovoltaics are becoming extremely affordable, and the most expensive components in a conventional module are the glass and transparent metals—components that are already in highly-insulating glazing. 5) Buildings are increasingly built to easily integrate with photovoltaic energy generation using DC microgrids and on-site energy generation to balance high demand on the grid. Rational design of PV windows is of paramount importance to realize their impact. In this work, we provide an analysis on the theoretical performance of PV windows using a detailed balance model to understand the complex design space of power conversion efficiency, visible light transmittance, solar heat gain coefficient, and color. We find there are two distinct regimes for PV window absorber design. The first lowvisible light transmittance regime validates the most prevalent approach to semitransparent PV windows in which conventional absorber materials (Si, CIGS, CdTe, CZTS, perovskite, etc.) are thinned to allow visible light to pass through. In this thinned-absorber regime, an ideal bandgap of ~1.35 eV maximizes performance, which is consistent with the famous Shockley–Queisser limit. However, we identify a second, high visible light  transmittance regime in which the ideal bandgap for maximum power conversion efficiency increases monotonically from 2 to 3 eV with increasing visible light transmittance. In this tuned-bandgap regime, the solar cell exhibits lower losses and tunable solar heat gain and color.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf9644d8c451d0018ea1e5c/,496,https://engrxiv.org/7s5qu/,10.31224/osf.io/7s5qu,10.1021/acsenergylett.9b01316,2019-06-06T21:20:21.966377,2019-09-05T01:53:05.296252
fq8ze,"Data Prognostics Using Symbolic Regression","This paper describes a general technique for data prognostics using symbolic regression. This analysis treats the characterization of turbofan engine degradation as a particular application for the general technique. The proposed genetic program (GP) characterizes engine degradation, and then uses that characterization to both detect engine faults and predict the remaining lifetimes of engines after a fault. The genetic program exploits the fact that engine degradation manifests itself as changing correlations between sensor outputs. The NASA Prognostics Data Repository provides a training set in which 100 simulated engines are run to failure, and a test set in which a separate set of 100 simulated engines are shut off before they fail. The GP uses the training fleet of engines to identify the sensor relationships that indicate engine fault and predict remaining lifetime, and then observes the learned sensor relationships in the test fleet. The genetic program successfully detects the moment that the fault occurs for every engine in the test fleet and accurately predicts the remaining lifetime of the engines after the fault.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf9218b3a4d9500178ae2f4/,456,https://engrxiv.org/fq8ze/,10.31224/osf.io/fq8ze,,2019-06-06T15:35:08.395890,2020-07-19T13:07:05.897133

However, recent work in engineering, design, and psychology contradicts this assumption. This work examines the behavior of teams engaged in data science competitions. Crowdsourced competitions have seen increased used for software development and data science, and platforms often encourage teamwork between participants.
Design/methodology/approach – We specifically examine teams participating in data science competitions hosted by Kaggle. We analyze data provided by Kaggle to compare the effect of team size and interaction frequency on team performance. We also contextualize these results through a semantic analysis.
Findings – This work demonstrates that groups of individuals working independently may outperform interacting teams on average, but that small, interacting teams are more likely to win competitions. The semantic analysis revealed differences in forum participation, verb usage, and pronoun usage when comparing top- and bottom-performing teams.
Research limitations/implications- These results reveal a perplexing tension that must be explored further: true teams may experience better performance with higher cohesion, but nominal teams may perform even better on average with essentially no cohesion. A limitation of this research includes not factoring in team member experience level and reliance on extant data.

However, they have inherent nonlinear elastic properties that can introduce a variation of their frequency with amplitude called isochronism defect. Previous research has focused on controlling the elastic behavior of flexure pivot oscillators to reach isochronism. We present a new way of minimizing the isochronism defect of rotational oscillators by varying their inertia. This principle is embodied in a new family of oscillators we call rotation-dilation coupled oscillator (RDCO).

Service composition and optimal selection (SCOS), which tackles the problem of optimally selecting and combining available resources into a composite service is one of them. To deal with this NP-hard problem, we developed a novel hybrid algorithm based on the recentlyintroduced grey wolf optimizer (GWO) in which evolutionary operators are also embedded into the hunting mechanism of the basic algorithm.
This approach not only makes it possible to adapt an algorithm with continuous structure such as GWO to solve a combinatorial problem such as SCOS, but also empowers it with providing higher exploration through crossover and mutation operators.

Validations of the adopted nonlinear finite element procedures are carried out against experimental results from three test series. After gaining confidence in the ability of the numerical models to predict closely the full inelastic response and failure modes, numerical investigations are carried out in order to examine the influence of key material and geometric parameters. The results of these numerical assessments enable the identification of three modes of failure as a function of the interaction between the shear-head and surrounding concrete. Based on the findings, coupled with results from previous studies, analytical models are proposed for predicting the rotational response as well as the ultimate strength of such slab systems. Practical recommendations are also provided for the design of shear-heads in RC slabs, including the embedment length and section size.

The problem is compounded by insufficient governmental funding, the lack of well-structured government policies, and a shortage of skilled maintenance staff at the schools. We evaluate the impact of a plumbing maintenance drive at 196 schools at the apex of the drought. Hypothesising that even the most basic maintenance could be a huge financial help to these schools, we gave plumbers a list of typical easy-gain repairs and restricted the budget to R5,000 per school, with some ad hoc exceptions. We then analysed the cost and benefit of these repairs, using data on the minimum night flow as recorded by smart water meters. We found an average of 28% reduction in MNF within five days of the reported maintenance date.

Managing the monthly bills is a huge task: the usage numbers on the bill are incomprehensible, the time-of-use tariff structure is bewilderingly complex, and the person who deals with payments is usually an overburdened teacher. This paper describes a controlled behavioural experiment carried out at five schools in Stellenbosch. We provided highly visualised and intuitive daily, weekly and monthly reports to three of the schools, the other two acting as controls. The reports were shared with teachers, principals and the governing body to encourage accountability. Usage was shown as a colour-coded energy and financial component per hour and per tariff class. Using the difference-in-differences method, we found financial savings of 11% and 14% at two of the schools and 13% at the third school, where staff were also trained on the tariff structure before reporting started. These results suggest that sharing high-frequency, digestible information could help South African schools reduce their energy bills; a saving that has particular relevance given the country’s dependence on fossil fuels.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cef28ec2a50c400167fa791/,460,https://engrxiv.org/v6ams/,10.31224/osf.io/v6ams,10.1016/j.erss.2019.05.022,2019-05-30T18:23:15.869753,2020-07-18T19:32:05.299214
za2p9,"Vegetation High-Impedance Faults' High-Frequency Signatures via Sparse Coding","The behavior of High-Impedance Faults (HIFs) in power distribution systems depends on multiple factors, making it a challenging disturbance to model. If enough data from real staged faults is provided, signal processing techniques can help reveal patterns from a specific type of fault. Such a task is implemented herein by employing the Shift-Invariant Sparse Coding (SISC) technique on a data set of staged vegetation high-impedance faults. The technique facilitates the uncoupling of shifted and convoluted patterns present in the recorded signals from fault tests. The deconvolution of these patterns was then individually studied to identify the possible repeating fault signatures. The work is primarily focused on the investigation of the under-discussed high-frequency faults signals, especially regarding voltage disturbances created by the fault currents. Therefore, the main contribution from this paper is the resulted evidence of consistent behavior from real vegetation HIFs at higher frequencies.

v5btz,"Rational Design of Ion Separation Membranes","Synthetic membranes for desalination and ion separation processes are a prerequisite for the supply of safe and sufficient drinking water as well as smart process water tailored to its application. This requires a versatile membrane fabrication methodology. Starting from an extensive set of new ion separation membranes synthesized with a layer-by-layer methodology, we demonstrate for the first time that an artificial neural network (ANN) can predict ion retention and water flux values based on membrane fabrication conditions. The predictive ANN is used in a local single-objective optimization approach to identify manufacturing conditions that improve permeability of existing membranes. A deterministic global multi-objective optimization is performed in order to identify the upper bound (Pareto front) of the delicate trade-off between ion retention characteristics and permeability. Ultimately, a coupling of the ANN into a hybrid model enables physical insight into the influence of fabrication conditions on apparent membrane properties.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cebcd858d6e05001a5f457d/,582,https://engrxiv.org/v5btz/,10.31224/osf.io/v5btz,10.1016/j.memsci.2018.10.013,2019-05-27T16:46:32.341028,2019-05-27T16:46:47.401218
5tg8e,"Shell and lumen side flow and pressure communication during permeation and filtration in a multibore polymer membrane module","This study reveals the importance of the module geometry on the flow field and pressure distribution during membrane permeation for multibore membranes. The pathways of permeation are unraveled within a custom-made multibore single membrane module. For this, we combine flow velocimetry of magnetic resonance imaging (flow-MRI) with computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations and permeation experiments. First, a systematic simulation study identifies flow patterns based on simplified geometrical features that are supported experimentally through flow-MRI measurements. This comprehensive study shows how small geometric deviations from the idealistic assumptions result in unexpected fluid flow on the shell and lumen side in the module. Second, the influence of those non-ideal flow patterns during the filtration of silica particles are revealed by MRI. The results indicate heterogeneous silica deposition due to geometry induced flow fields. Contrary to the idealized assumption, the subsequent backwashing is also influenced by those deposition patterns. Hence, unavoidable non-idealities of membrane positioning during the construction of the module influence the performance of the membrane filtration. With this study, we stimulate to analyze and pioneer new strategies to optimize module design and fully recover the membrane's performance after filtration cycles during backwashing. Even more, extensive future studies on multiple multibore membranes can reveal their mutual interaction closing the gap between the single multibore membrane behavior and multibore membrane module properties.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cebc8f78d6e05001960cdab/,321,https://engrxiv.org/5tg8e/,10.31224/osf.io/5tg8e,10.1016/j.memsci.2019.04.070,2019-05-27T16:45:48.469362,2019-05-27T16:46:07.232928
6n53p,"Closing the cycle: phosphorus removal and recovery from diluted e?uents using acid resistive membranes","New regulations in many developed countries call for significant reduction in phosphorus concentration for effluents released to the environment. At the same time, recovery of phosphorus – a non-renewable resource used mainly as fertilizer – from anthropogenic waste is extensively studied and bolstered as a crucial component in maintaining future food security. Thus far, studies on phosphorus recovery mainly focused on concentrated streams; although diluted effluents such as treated wastewater often contain a significant portion of the phosphorus mass. Here we propose a new approach for the simultaneous removal and recovery of phosphorus from diluted effluents using a membrane characterized by high phosphate rejection and acid resistance. High P rejection allows for the concentration of phosphorus in the retentate until recoverable calcium-phosphate precipitants are formed, while acid resistance enables a simple and effective chemical cleaning of the membrane. Factors affecting the removal and recovery of phosphorus during filtration are studied here experimentally and through thermochemical modeling. CaCO3 precipitation in the retentate resulted in severe scaling, whereas calcium-phosphate precipitated mostly in the bulk, resulting in colloidal fouling which was manageable by maintaining sub-critical permeate flux. Selective Ca-P precipitation is feasible via pH adjustments, requiring very little acid addition as shown through thermochemical modeling. Calcium-phosphate deposits were easily removed from the feed channel using acid-cleaning, and the permeate flux was completely restored. Furthermore, phosphorus removal and recovery by nanofiltration was shown to require less operating expenses compared to a more conventional approach comprising P removal by ferric chloride addition and its subsequent recovery from incinerated sludge. Our results therefore demonstrate the potential of this new approach as a step forward towards closing the anthropogenic phosphorus cycle.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cebc73a23fec40018e6b2a8/,498,https://engrxiv.org/6n53p/,10.31224/osf.io/6n53p,10.1016/j.cej.2018.03.181,2019-05-27T16:44:15.733228,2019-05-27T16:44:47.580370
jq7u9,"2D Patterned Ion-Exhange Membranes Induce Electroconvection","Concentration polarization is a diffusion‐limited phenomenon for ion transport in electrodialysis based desalination processes. Once a so‐called limiting current is reached, the resistance of the system rises notably manifested as a plateau region in the current–voltage curves. For long it is hypothesized that altering the surface properties of the membrane can overcome the diffusional transport limitation by the induction of electroconvective vortices mixing the laminar boundary layer. To systematically investigate the influence of geometrical and chemical membrane surface topology on the evolution of electroconvection, circular patterns of polystyrene, poly(2‐vinylpyridine) (P2VP), and P2VP microgels are inkjet printed on cation‐exchange membranes. All types of patterns cause an insignificant increase in membrane resistance but they reduce the plateau lengths indicating the desired accelerated onset of electroconvection. In case of polystyrene (PS) patterns, the drop in plateau length results in a small reduction in transport resistance for overlimiting currents. However, membranes modified with linear P2VP and P2VP microgel patterns do exhibit a significantly decreased resistance in this region at a simultaneous increase of the limiting current density. Direct numerical simulations support the interpretation that the surface charge of the printed patterns influences the direction of the vortices being advantageous during ion transport toward the membrane.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cebc6992a50c400167deda5/,474,https://engrxiv.org/jq7u9/,10.31224/osf.io/jq7u9,10.1002/admi.201801309,2019-05-27T16:39:47.729125,2019-05-27T16:40:13.672920

First, a batch mode decomposition and recombination of the MgCl2, Na2SO4, and K2SO4 solutions was studied with varying initial concentrations. Current efficiencies of ∼100% were observed for each cycle. In a so-called decomposition step, two different salt solutions are decomposed into electrically charged slurries having the counterions adsorbed. Swapping the slurries with the stored counterions during the recombination step results into new salt solutions upon discharge including the desired product. Both, purity of products and overall conversion of ions into the products, depend on operational parameters, while maximal achieved MgSO4 purity was as high as 93% with a concentration factor of 6.3 and a discharge current efficiency of ∼85%. Finally, a semicontinuous FCDI metathesis system was investigated. Performing the recombination step at appropriate process conditions also allows the concentration of the resulting product solutions by a factor as high as 81.5 with MgSO4 purity of ∼80% and current efficiencies of 96%.

Recently, slurry electrodes (or flow suspension electrodes) were introduced as a potentially viable electrode system. Such electrode systems are little understood so far. Mass, momentum and charge transfer phenomena co-occur, interactions with each other are nearly impossible to capture experimentally. We present a novel discrete model of the particulate phase combining theories from fluid dynamics, colloidal physics, and electrochemistry with a coupled CFD-DEM approach. The methodology allows to visualize local phenomena occurring during the charging of the battery and to compute the net current of the slurry electrode system.

Conventional production methods of microfluidic chips have been limited to planar structures, preventing the exploitation of truly three-dimensional architectures for applications such as multi-phase droplet preparation or wet-phase fibre spinning. Here the challenge of nanofabrication inside a microfluidic chip is tackled for the showcase of a spider-inspired spinneret. Multiphoton lithography, an additive manufacturing method, was used to produce free-form microfluidic masters, subsequently replicated by soft lithography. Into the resulting microfluidic device, a three-dimensional spider-inspired spinneret was directly fabricated in-chip via multiphoton lithography. Applying this unprecedented fabrication strategy, the to date smallest printed spinneret nozzle is produced. This spinneret resides tightly sealed, connecting it to the macroscopic world. Its functionality is demonstrated by wet-spinning of single-digit micron fibres through a polyacrylonitrile coagulation process induced by a water sheath layer. The methodology developed here demonstrates fabrication strategies to interface complex architectures into classical microfluidic platforms. Using multiphoton lithography for in-chip fabrication adopts a high spatial resolution technology for improving geometry and thus flow control inside microfluidic chips.

r59ku,"Sinusoidal shaped hollow fibers for enhanced mass transfer","Geometrically structured flow channels induce secondary flows and vortices enhancing mass and heat transport rates. In particular, these vortices may reduce concentration polarization and subsequent fouling in membrane transport processes. In this work we present a new method of producing hollow fiber membranes with a sinusoidal change in diameter along the fiber length. We engineered a pulsation module that imposes a sinusoidally fluctuating bore liquid flow rate. Harmonic bore flow conditions can be varied over a wide range of operational settings. The fluctuating bore liquid flow rate translates into axial membrane properties varying with respect to inner bore diameter and wall thickness.

We suggest that the resulting narrowing and widening of the membrane lumen channel induces secondary vortices to the liquid feed inside the membrane lumen. In gas/liquid membrane absorption processes these secondary vortices reduce the diffusional resistance, also known as the Bellhouse effect. For the produced hydrophobic PVDF membranes, improved oxygen transport from shell-to-lumen side prove superiority over straight hollow fiber membranes in G/L absorption process by a factor of 2.5 at higher liquid flow rates. We anticipate the dynamic flow module to be easily integrated into currently existing hollow fiber membrane spinning processes.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cebc3d923fec40019e7f275/,333,https://engrxiv.org/r59ku/,10.31224/osf.io/r59ku,10.1016/j.memsci.2017.03.030,2019-05-27T15:41:28.094156,2019-05-27T15:41:48.369187

The battery cells possess non-scalable fixed electrodes inserted into a cell stack. In contrast, a conductive particle network dispersed in the electrolyte, known as slurry electrode, may be beneficial for a scalable redox flow battery. In this work, slurry electrodes are successfully introduced to an all-vanadium redox flow battery. Activated carbon and graphite powder particles are dispersed up to 20 wt% in the vanadium electrolyte and charge-discharge behavior is inspected via polarization studies. Graphite powder slurry is superior over activated carbon with a polarization behavior closer to the standard graphite felt electrodes. 3D-printed conductive static mixers introduced to the slurry channel improve the charge transfer via intensified slurry mixing and increased surface area. Consequently, a significant increase in the coulombic efficiency up to 95% and energy efficiency up to 65% is obtained. Our results show that slurry electrodes supported by conductive static mixers can be competitive to state-of-the-art electrodes yielding an additional degree of freedom in battery design.

uv7c2,"3D-printed electrodes with improved mass transport properties","Today's electrochemical reactor design is a less developed discipline as compared to electrocatalytic synthesis. Although catalysts show increasing conversion rates, they are often operated without measures for the reduction of concentration polarization effects. As a result, a stagnant boundary layer forms at the electrode‐electrolyte interface. This stagnant boundary layer presents an additional voltage drop and reduces the energy efficiency. It is generally accepted that this phenomenon is caused by a combination of fast electrode reactions and slow diffusion of the reacting species. Our earlier work demonstrated the potential of non‐conducting static mixers to reduce concentration polarization effects. However, there are few studies on conductive static mixers applied as electrodes. In this study, we present a new concept of additive manufactured flow through electrode mixers. Our electrode geometry combines a high surface area with mixing properties, diminishing concentration polarization effects of transport‐limited reactions.

c267u,"Fouling Mitigation in Tubular Membranes by 3D-printed Twisted Tape Turbulence Promoters","Despite intensive research, fouling remains a severe problem in membrane filtration. It is often controlled by applying turbulent flow which requires a higher energy consumption. So-called turbulence promoters or static mixers can be inserted into the flow channel of tubular membranes. They deflect the fluid, induce vortices, enhance particle back-transport and increase the shear rate at the membrane surface, thus mitigating fouling. However, little is known how the geometry of such turbulence promotors affects the reduction of fouling. We investigate how different 3D-printed mixer geometries affect fouling and improve the flux during filtration with humic acid. Most mixer geometries used in the present study are based on a twisted tape; a Kenics static mixer is investigated as well. Static mixers with changing diameter prove to be less effective than twisted tape mixers with constant diameter which lead to an increase in permeate flux of around 130%. The highest flux improvement of 140% can be reached by applying a Kenics mixer. Regardless of their geometry, all investigated static mixer cause higher permeate fluxes at same specific energy consumption. Again, the Kenics mixer proves to be the most efficient static mixer. The presented mixer geometries can be fabricated with undercut injection molding techniques and represent a simple and viable option to make tubular membrane based filtration processes more efficient.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cebc0692a50c4001782b4cc/,421,https://engrxiv.org/c267u/,10.31224/osf.io/c267u,10.1016/j.memsci.2018.02.015,2019-05-27T14:47:52.160991,2020-07-18T13:30:46.675706

Yet, it is well known that geometrical topologies can introduce secondary flow patterns counteracting mass transport limitations, stemming from diffusion resistances and fouling. We present a new systematic methodology to fabricate novel membrane architectures. We use the freedom of design by 3D-printing spinnerets, having multiple bore channels of any geometry. First, such spinnerets are stationary to fabricate straight bore channels inside a monolithic membrane. Second, in an even more complex design, a new mechanical system enables rotating the spinneret. Such rotating multibore spinnerets enable (A) the preparation of twisted channels inside a porous monolithic membrane as well as (B) a helical twist of the outside geometry. The spun material systems comprise classical polymer solutions as well as metal-polymer slurries resulting in solid porous metallic monolithic membrane after thermal post-processing. It is known that twisted spiral-type bore channel geometries are potentially superior to straight channels with respect to mass and heat polarization phenomena, however their fabrication was cumbersome in the past. Now, the described methodology enables membrane fabrication to tailor the membrane geometry to the needs of the membrane process.

The aim is usually load-shifting (by heating water at off-peak times) and/or maximising time-of-use pricing benefits for users. The scheduling tends not to be linked to actual hot water usage and depends largely on stored thermal energy. Heat losses therefore tend to be greater than if the heater ran without a break. The effect of such a control strategy is thus to worsen the energy loss and in most cases increase greenhouse gas emissions. Many developing countries have flat-pricing (no time-of-use incentives) and rely heavily on energy from fossil fuels, making these considerations even more pressing. We explore three strategies for optimal control of domestic water heating that do not use thermostat control: matching the delivery temperature in the hot water, matching the energy delivered in the hot water, and a variation of the second strategy which provides for Legionella sterilisation. For each of these strategies we examine the energy used in heating, the energy delivered at the tank outlet, and issues of convenience to the user. The study differs from most previous work in that it uses real daily hot-water usage profiles, ensures like-for-like comparison in delivered energy at the point of use, and includes a daily Legionella avoidance strategy. We tackled this as an optimal control problem using dynamic programming. Our results demonstrate a median energy saving of between 8\ and 18% for the three strategies. Even more savings would be realised if intended and unintended usage events are correctly classified, and the optimal control only plans for intended usage events.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cdb46e12d1b9e001ba323d2/,667,https://engrxiv.org/xnq4t/,10.31224/osf.io/xnq4t,10.1016/j.esd.2019.05.004,2019-05-15T13:00:45.581452,2020-07-17T12:32:58.652728
5xv76,"Frequency Analysis of Vortex Shedding in Wake Area behind the NACA0012 Airfoil via Fully-Lagrangian Vortex Element Method","Shedding frequency of the vortices of the low-pressure area behind NACA0012 airfoil cross-section is provided for a laminar flow of an incompressible viscose fluid using Lagrangian vortex elements scheme. In the current work, only those areas of the solution domain were modeled where there are velocity gradients. It was done by the vorticity transfer equation that was obtained by calculating the cross product of the sides of the momentum equation. According to the Fractional Step method, the vorticity transfer equation was separated into two different equations that were solved sequentially in each time step: non-linear convection equation and the linear diffusion equation. Vorticity field in the physical domain was separated by the sheet and bubble vortices and each of the vortex elements in the solving field moved according to Biot-Savar Law and diffused according to the random walk method. The flow around the airfoil was obtained using Joukowsly mapping of the solution of the flow around a circle. This work was validated by comparing the aerodynamics force coefficients obtained from the vortex elements method with those obtained from analytical methods. Vortex shedding frequencies were calculated using the Fourier transform of the time response of the changes in the aerodynamic forces, being compared to the experimental results under the same conditions.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cda3709c2ae0b001a4cd77a/,558,https://engrxiv.org/5xv76/,10.31224/osf.io/5xv76,,2019-05-14T17:41:32.692497,2020-03-24T18:47:32.530942
meb53,"A comparative evaluation of the impact of average speed enforcement (ASE) on passenger and minibus taxi vehicle drivers on the R61 in South Africa","Average Speed Enforcement (ASE) is an emergent alternative to instantaneous speed limit enforcement to improve road safety, and is used to enforce an average speed limit over a road segment. This paper presents a study on the response of passenger vehicles and minibus taxis to ASE on the R61 in South Africa. A spatio-temporal quantitative study of speed compliance is conducted, where metrics such as speed variability, average speed and 85th percentile speed measured prior to, and during enforcement are analysed for two prominent modes of transport – passenger vehicles and minibus taxis. These measurements are taken on the enforcement route and on control routes adjacent to and further away from the enforcement route. A qualitative study is also conducted to evaluate the relationship between speed compliance and driver understanding of the system. The impact of the system on crash risk and injury severity is also examined before and during enforcement. For passenger vehicles, results show that the introduction of ASE was followed by a reduction in mean speed on the enforcement route and adjacent control route. For minibus taxis, it was found that ASE appears to have little influence on improving speed compliance, which is likely associated with a lack of driver understanding on how the system operates.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cda34abdb3c0a0017cfef6b/,422,https://engrxiv.org/meb53/,10.31224/osf.io/meb53,10.17159/2309-8775/2016/v58n4a1,2019-05-14T17:40:26.514605,2020-07-17T12:50:38.687770
m67ew,"On the analytical approach to the linear analysis of an arbitrarily curved spatial Bernoulli-Euler beam","The equilibrium and kinematic equations of an arbitrarily curved spatial Bernoulli-Euler beam are derived with respect to a parametric coordinate and compared with those of the Timoshenko beam. It is shown that the beam analogy follows from the fact that the left-hand side in all the four sets of those equations are the covariant derivatives of unknown vector. Furthermore, an elegant primal form of the equilibrium equations is composed. No additional assumptions, besides those of the linear Bernoulli-Euler theory, are introduced, which makes the theory ideally suited for the analytical assessment of big-curvature beams. The curvature change is derived with respect to both convective and material/spatial coordinates, and some aspects of its definition are discussed. Additionally, the stiffness matrix of an arbitrarily curved spatial beam is calculated with the flexibility approach utilizing the relative coordinate system. The numerical analysis of the carefully selected set of examples proved that the present analytical formulation can deliver valid benchmark results for testing of the purely numeric methods.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cd9658a840cae0018703dec/,439,https://engrxiv.org/m67ew/,10.31224/osf.io/m67ew,,2019-05-13T14:17:42.671076,2020-07-17T12:51:00.164653

vxw6g,"Improved day ahead heating demand forecasting by online correction methods","To reduce the heating and cooling energy demand of buildings and districts novel control strategies are constantly being developed that require information on the future demand of the controlled entity. Demand forecasting is commonly done with deterministic white box models or fitted grey-box models, however, recently more and more data and machine learning based approaches are being developed. All approaches have weaknesses: white-box models require major modelling effort, grey-box approaches are limited by their model or parameter complexity and machine learning is dependent on hyperparameters, some of which are randomly chosen, and therefore considered unreliable. 
Here we develop a forecasting approach based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and introduce error correction methods based on online learning and the learned autocorrelation of the forecasting error. We compare the approach to other regression based and grey-box methods in a real case study of a small-scale district energy system with mixed use and unknown lower-level control. We show that the proposed method outperforms the other forecasting methods in terms of average error and coefficient of determination. We further demonstrate that in our case study the error correction methods significantly reduce variance in ANN performance created by randomly initialized parameters in the networks.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cd92d75f244ec001ee7ff31/,637,https://engrxiv.org/vxw6g/,10.31224/osf.io/vxw6g,,2019-05-13T14:12:53.046463,2019-05-13T14:13:27.174233

The technologies with the best optical properties demonstrated to date in large fabrics (&gt;100 ports) are 3D MEMS beam steering approaches. These have low average insertion losses, and equally important, a narrow loss distribution. However, 3D MEMS fabrics are generally dismissed from serious consideration for this application because of their slow switching speeds (~few milliseconds) and costs ($100/port).

Methods: We recorded transverse cervical ultrasound (US) images and whole-body motion analysis of sixty-one standing participants (35 cervical dystonia, 26 age matched controls). We manually annotated 3,100 images sampling a range of pitch, yaw, and roll head movements (2,000 this dataset, 1,100 previous dataset of 28 healthy participants), and trained, validated and tested a deep residual deconvolutional neural network (DCNN) to classify pixels to 13 categories (five paired neck muscles, skin, ligamentum nuchae, vertebra). For all participants in their normal standing posture, we generated held out DCNN segmented US images, extracted segmentation boundaries, transformed the boundaries to principal components and clustered the dystonia participants into two groups using their component scores. Results: For all segments, metrics of segmentation accuracy were Jaccard Index (50±21%) and Hausdorff Distance (5.8±4 mm). For the four deep muscle layers, their boundaries were used to predict central injection sites for each muscle with average precision 94±2%. Using 10-fold cross-validation to select predictive components, linear analysis of component scores identified two significant eigen-patterns discriminating Dystonia from Controls and classifying group membership (Dystonia1, Dystonia2, Control) correctly at 93.4%.

In this paper, the thermodynamic behavior of the Thermal Protection System (TPS) used bolted joints made up of porous ZrO2/(ZrO2+Ni) FGMs is investigated by finite-element (FE) modeling. The bolted joint is subjected to reentry heating corresponding to the Access to Space Vehicle. Thermodynamic simulations are carried out to yield the transient response of the porous ZrO2/(ZrO2+Ni) functionally graded bolted joint (FGBJ). The effects of the preload on the thermomechanical behavior and service reliability of the bolted joint are numerically analyzed in detail by ABAQUS codes. It is found that the preload relaxation of the bolted joint occurs at elevated temperature, and the preload has significant influence on service reliability of the bolted joint under transient thermomechanical circumstances. With the increase of the preload, stress concentration which occurs at the root of the first thread of the bolt increases rapidly and predominates in service reliability. Proper preload is thus defined to balance the service reliability and tightness of the bolted joint. Further studies show that the shape of the nut has a great effect on the stress concentration of the thread, the optimized nut is designed to reduce the stress concentration of the thread, and thus the reliability of the bolted joint is also improved.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cc7210000a81000175be4ca/,391,https://engrxiv.org/bvhzc/,10.31224/osf.io/bvhzc,10.1016/j.compositesb.2015.07.018,2019-04-29T16:46:33.143636,2019-04-29T19:39:23.490648

In this paper, based on the nanoindentation test, the field distribution of the residual stress of porous ZrO2/(ZrO2+Ni) ceramic-metal FGMs is measured. The residual stress field measured by nanoindentation agrees qualitatively with the finite element simulation results. Then a constitutive relation is established to investigate the effects of residual stress on the macroscopic deformation behavior of porous ZrO2/(ZrO2+Ni) FGMs, which agrees well with the bending and compression experiments. It is found that residual stress can improve both the flexural strength and stiffness of the porous ZrO2/(ZrO2+Ni) FGMs, by densifying and compensating the tensile stress of the porous middle layer (ZrO2) during the bending process, respectively.

The purpose of this paper is to problematise the relationship between layers of engineering that constitute the multidisciplinary systems which require contextualised and responsive engagement with data. Using a number of social realist analytical instruments, the forms of knowledge and related practices at different levels within the ‘smart engineering’ curriculum are interrogated and subsequently illustrated so as to guide pedagogic decisions. The intention of the research is primarily to enable students to effectively develop 1) integrated systems-level thinking, and 2) appropriate, interpretative data processing skills. There is a symbiotic and analogical relationship between the design of a curricular framework for the ‘smart engineer’ and the collaborative, interdisciplinary research approach: drawing on multiple perspectives and approaches from the hard and soft sciences enables a more informed educational design process.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cc297d3e6878600171416d0/,431,https://engrxiv.org/nbh6c/,10.31224/osf.io/nbh6c,,2019-04-26T12:48:16.795916,2019-04-28T01:52:43.620183

For this, we changed the application and review process to include an assessment of applicants’ non-cognitive variables based on Sedlacek’s work and the Fisk-Vanderbilt MS-PhD Bridge Program admissions model.  In 2016, our Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) Department piloted the incorporation of these changes.

dh3ba,"Strengthening of the Panel Zone in Steel Moment Resisting Frames","Rehabilitation and retrofitting of structures designed in accordance to standard design codes is an essential practice in structural engineering and design. For steel structures, one of the challenges is to strengthen the panel zone as well as its analysis in moment-resisting frames. In this research, investigations were undertaken to analyze the influence of the panel zone in the response of structural frames through a computational approach using ETABS software. Moment-resisting frames of six stories were studied in supposition of real panel zone, different values of rigid zone factor, different thickness of double plates, and both double plates and rigid zone factor together. The frames were analyzed, designed and validated in accordance to Iranian steel building code. The results of drift values for six stories building models were plotted. After verifying and comparing the results, the findings showed that the rigidity lead to reduction in drifts of frames and also as a result, lower rigidity will be used for high rise building and higher rigidity will be used for low rise building. In frames with story drifts more than the permitted rate, where the frames are considered as the weaker panel zone area, the story drifts can be limited by strengthening the panel zone with double plates. It should be noted that higher thickness of double plates and higher rigidity of panel zone will result in enhancement of the non-linear deformation rates in beam elements. The resulting deformations of the panel zone due to this modification can have significant influence on the elastic and inelastic behavior of the frames.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cbf5273870f9f0017201f03/,831,https://engrxiv.org/dh3ba/,10.31224/osf.io/dh3ba,,2019-04-23T18:49:09.687736,2020-07-16T21:37:22.712510

The Monarch is a 2.5-gram spacecraft that is the first to trade quantity, rather than cost, for low mission risk. By taking advantage of recent technological advancements in unrelated disciplines and taking a statistical approach to mission assurance, R-selected spacecraft open the door to an entirely new paradigm in space access and exploration. This paper describes the challenges and advantages unique to gram-scale, R-selected spacecraft. It also presents a number of use cases --- involving distributed in-situ sensing and planetary science --- that are unique to spacecraft of the Monarch's diminutive size and large quantity. Results from simulated lunar impact survival tests and a case-study planetary science mission are presented and discussed, suggesting one particular use case.

In this paper, we developed a prototype national-scale Twitter data mining pipeline for improved stakeholder situational awareness during flooding events across Great Britain, by retrieving relevant social geodata, grounded in environmental data sources (flood warnings and river levels). With potential users we identified and addressed three research questions to develop this application, whose components constitute a modular architecture for real-time dashboards. First, polling national flood warning and river level Web data sources to obtain at-risk locations. Secondly, real-time retrieval of geotagged tweets, proximate to at-risk areas. Thirdly, filtering flood-relevant tweets with natural language processing and machine learning libraries, using word embeddings of tweets.

Several experimental and analytical studies on the confinement effect and failure mechanisms of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) wrapped columns have been conducted over recent years. Although typical axial members are large-scale square/ rectangular reinforced concrete (RC) columns in practice, the majority of such studies have concentrated on the behavior of small-scale circular concrete specimens. A high performance concrete, known as polymer concrete, made up of natural aggregates and an orthophthalic polyester binder, reinforced with non-metallic bars (glass reinforced polymer) has been studied. The material is described at micro and macro level, presenting the key physical and mechanical properties using different experimental techniques. Furthermore, a full description of non-metallic bars is presented to evaluate its structural expectancies, embedded in the polymer concrete matrix. In this paper, the mechanism of mechanical interaction of smooth and lugged FRP rods with concrete is presented. A general modeling and application of various elements are demonstrated. The contact parameters are defined and the procedures of calculation and evaluation of contact parameters are introduced. The method of calibration of the calculated parameters is presented. Finally, the numerical results are obtained for different bond parameters which show a good agreement with experimental results reported in literature",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb805573992690017132d65/,654,https://engrxiv.org/w63cr/,10.31224/osf.io/w63cr,10.12989/cac.2019.23.1.061,2019-04-18T15:44:49.027563,2019-04-18T15:58:03.508183
dr2ua,"Effects of external mechanical loading on stress generation during lithiation in Li-ion battery electrodes","Li-ion batteries are ineluctably subjected to external mechanical loading or stress gradient. Such stress can be induced in battery electrode during fabrication and under normal operation. In this paper, we develop a model for stresses generated during lithiation in the thin plate electrode considering the effects of external mechanical loading. It is found that diffusion-induced stresses are asymmetrically distributed through the thickness of plate due to the coupling effects of asymmetrically distributed external mechanical stress. At the very early stage during Li-ions insertion, the effects of the external mechanical loading is quite limited and unobvious. With the diffusion time increasing, the external mechanical loading exerts a significant influence on the evolution of stresses generated in the electrode. External compressed electrode is inclined to increase the value of stresses generated during lithiation, while external tensed electrode tends to decrease the value of stresses, and as the diffusion time increases, the effects of the external mechanical loading on the stresses generated during lithiation become more obvious.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb5a08b3992690017117970/,392,https://engrxiv.org/dr2ua/,10.31224/osf.io/dr2ua,10.1016/j.electacta.2015.10.097,2019-04-16T14:51:41.327198,2019-04-16T14:58:32.327891

Cementitious material is modeled using the non-ordinary state-based peridynamic theory. The nonlocal meshfree peridynamic method uniﬁes mechanics of continuous and discontinuous media and thus is well-suited in simulating discontinuities such as cracks compared to the traditional mesh-based ﬁnite element method. In addition, the non-ordinary state-based peridynamics enables us to incorporate classical constitutive equations and damage criterion. Furthermore, in order to incorporate ﬁber within the cementitious composite, a modiﬁed semi-discrete model is introduced. A two-dimensional rectangular notched model is developed to study the eﬀect of ﬁber amount and ﬁber length on mechanical response of cementitious composite and also on damage propagation pattern.

Recent advances in solar PV affordability, the advent of the smartgrid and the capacitive nature of water heaters could be combined to enable new methods for electricity cost and efficiency management without affecting user comfort.
Control methods that combine excess PV energy dumping and real-time temperature-based prioritised scheduling were compared with the normally-employed thermostat control. In addition, the performance of an energy-optimising approach is compared with a peak demand optimising approach.

In this study, molecular dynamics simulation informed continuum chemo-mechanical modelings with conservation integrals were conducted to derive fracture toughness of LixSi alloys. Our modeling results show reasonable agreement with available experimental data, revealing that the fracture toughness of LixSi alloys with low lithium concentration does not vary significantly with lithium concentration. In addition, we demonstrated that, if lithium redistribution caused by the stress gradient around crack tip needs to be considered, an appropriate chemo-mechanical path-independent J-integral should be used as the classic Rice's J-integral is path-dependent. The obtained fracture toughness of the LixSi alloys here provides guidance for the rational design of Si based electrodes, and the presented approach also sheds light for the evaluation of the fracture toughness of other energy materials at different charging/discharging levels.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb48e5339926900160f8384/,734,https://engrxiv.org/zqadm/,10.31224/osf.io/zqadm,,2019-04-15T14:35:40.274082,2020-07-16T21:15:01.252463
wfv2x,"POST-EVENT PLASTIC FAILURE ANALYSIS OF SHEAR FRAMES FROM THEIR PRE-EVENT ELASTIC RESPONSE","We demonstrate that plastic failure loads of shear frames can be inferred from their elastic ambient response. The interstory plastic mechanism force is derived for moment-resisting (rigid) frames as a function of two measured elastic (low-amplitude) frequencies. Structural health monitoring techniques are traditionally devised for “post-event” assessment of structures after exposure of a facility to a potentially damaging loading event such as strong earthquakes or blasts. The knowledge of induced damage, its location, and severity in an otherwise functioning
structure, as important as it is, may be too late for precautionary preparations. Naturally, one is interested in identiﬁcation of potential failure mechanisms and indicators prior to damaging events when a structure is responding to environmental loads elastically. Are post-event plastic failure loads identiﬁable from the pre-event ambient response? We answer this question by ﬁrst deriving interstory shear stiﬀness values from a set of measured ambient frequencies that are then incorporated into post-elastic equilibrium equations for a closed-form expression of failure loads as a function of measured frequencies. We test our procedure using a typical shear frame example as proof of concept. To extend the relevance and applicability of the proposed procedure we consider uncertainties associated with the measured and estimated quantities and assess their eﬀects in our model output. The closed-form solutions presented allow study of fully-stressed designs and we present the optimal stiﬀness distribution for such designs as another example. It is anticipated that temporal relevance of structural health monitoring techniques to “pre-event” assessment will be extended in the near future to such promising technologies as earthquake early warning systems.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb37563353c58001b9bdcff/,355,https://engrxiv.org/wfv2x/,10.31224/osf.io/wfv2x,,2019-04-15T13:34:27.266567,2019-04-15T13:35:05.666666

The study demonstrated significant reduction in the concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin (p=0.0032) and alpha rhythm power (p=0.0213) on the PFC under stress condition. Specifically, the right PFC and dorsolateral PFC were highly sensitive to mental stress.

6a2tn,"Tomographic Processing of Synthetic Aperture Radar Signals for Enhanced Resolution","Spotlight-mode synthetic aperture radar imaging is studied from the viewpoint of tomographic signal processing which allows the relaxation of the nearly-universal assumption that plane waves pass over the ground patch. This allows high-quality image reconstruction in the face of arbitrary amounts of wavefront curvature such as would be present when the angle subtended by the ground patch, as seen by the radar, is not small. One such application is wide-area surveillance. A meth- odology is used which has the benefits of a wideband transmitted signal (impulse) and a sensible simulation. Image reconstruction algorithms are developed for monostatic and bistatic systems. Simulation results using these algorithms compare favorably with baseline simulations which use a more conventional algorithm operating on data which do not embody the effects of wavefront curvature. Comments on system design and computational implementation are made as necessary. A new set of problems which appear to benefit from the tomographic viewpoint is posed.

3p8cj,"Simple models for the operation of partially transparent radiative windows and their comparison to the radiative coolers","In this work we solve approximately the radiative heat transfer problem in one dimension to perform a comparative analysis of the time averaged performance of the partially transparent radiative windows and radiative coolers. Our physical model includes the atmosphere, the window, and the backwall that are all in the thermal equilibrium with each other, and that can exchange energy via radiative heat transfer or convection. Moreover, we use a simplified two-state model for the optical properties of an atmosphere and a window material which assumes two distinct sets of the optical reflection/absorption/transmission parameters in the visible/near-IR versus mid-IR spectral ranges. Furthermore, we have distinguished the design goals for the partially transparent windows and radiative coolers and provided optimal choice for the material parameters to realize these goals. Thus, radiative coolers are normally non-transparent in the visible, and the main goal is to design a cooler with the temperature of its dark side as low as possible compared to that of the atmosphere. For the radiative windows, however, their surfaces are necessarily partially transparent in the visible. In the cooling mode, therefore, the main question is about the maximal visible light transmission through the window at which the temperature on the window somber side does not exceed that of the atmosphere. We believe that our simple physical models complimented with an in-depth comparative analysis of the radiative windows and coolers can be of interest to a number of scientists and engineers pursuing research in these disciplines.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cabc780404d5f0017ef0e0f/,455,https://engrxiv.org/3p8cj/,10.31224/osf.io/3p8cj,,2019-04-08T22:21:45.283158,2019-05-31T16:40:42.667824

To avoid this, stress quantification is important for clinical intervention and disease prevention. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of exploiting Electroencephalography (EEG) signals to discriminate between different stress levels. We propose a new assessment protocol whereby the stress level is represented by the complexity of mental arithmetic (MA) task for example, at three levels of difficulty, and the stressors are time pressure and negative feedback. Using 18-male subjects, the experimental results showed that there were significant differences in EEG response between the control and stress conditions at different levels of MA task with p-values &lt; 0.001. Furthermore, we found a significant reduction in alpha rhythm power from one stress level to another level, p-values &lt;0.05. In comparison, results from self-reporting questionnaire NASA-TLX approach showed no significant differences between stress levels. In addition, we developed a discriminant analysis method based on multiclass support vector machine (SVM) with error-correcting output code (ECOC). Different stress levels were detected with an average classification accuracy of 94.79%.

X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), and nitrogen physisorption were used to characterize the prepared samples. The XRD results indicated after cobalt doping, we obtained rutile phase as the major phase for cobalt containing samples. The band gap energy of the synthesized samples were calculated by Kubelka-Munk equation using diffuse reflectance spectra. The surface area of the samples was obtained by BET model and average pore diameter and pore volume of the samples were extracted from desorption branch of BJH model. The effectiveness of the samples was examined through degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) as a model of organic pollutants under visible light. We achieved 27% and 50% visible light degradation of 2,4-DCP in the presence of pure TiO2 and Co-TiO2/CNTs after 180 min irradiation, respectively. The high visible light activity of Co-TiO2/CNTs sample can be approved that the presence of cobalt and CNTs reduce the band gap energy and sensitize TiO2 surface to visible light respectively.

ygxau,"Explicit Stencil Computation Schemes Generated by Poisson's Formula for the 2D Wave Equation","An approach to building explicit time-marching stencil computation schemes for the transient 2D acoustic wave equation without using finite-difference approximations is proposed and implemented. It is based on using the integral representation formula (Poisson's formula) that provides the exact solution of the initial-value problem for the transient 2D scalar wave equation at any time point through the initial conditions. For the purpose of constructing a two-step time-marching algorithm, a modified integral representation formula involving three time levels is also employed.  It is shown that integrals in the two representation formulas are exactly calculated if the initial conditions and the sought solution at each time level as functions of spatial coordinates are approximated by stencil interpolation polynomials in the neighborhood of any point in a 2D Cartesian grid. As a result, if a uniform time grid is chosen, the proposed time-marching algorithm consists of two numerical procedures: 1) the solution calculation at the first time-step through the initial conditions; 2) the solution calculation at the second and next time-steps using a generated two-step numerical scheme. 

Three particular explicit stencil schemes (with five, nine and 13 space points) are built using the proposed approach. Their stability regions are presented. The obtained stencil expressions are compared with the corresponding finite-difference schemes available in the literature. Their novelty features are discussed. Simulation results with new and conventional schemes are presented for two benchmark problems that have exact solutions. It is demonstrated that using the new first time-step calculation procedure instead of the conventional one can provide a significant improvement of accuracy even for later time steps.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ca7642033122500188ff936/,407,https://engrxiv.org/ygxau/,10.31224/osf.io/ygxau,,2019-04-05T14:47:45.060301,2020-07-16T21:16:30.163875

Additionally, the data is used to determine the success of educational and rebate programmes aimed at reducing residential energy usage and to determine possible motivations for encouraging users to reduce or alter their EWH energy and warm water consumption. The results of this questionnaire indicate that: convenience is a key factor in consumers’ willingness to implement curtailment actions; users don’t understand the energy consumption of their EWHs; and they don’t know how to control their EWHs efficiently.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ca54597c25afd001cdeb20b/,646,https://engrxiv.org/94wfg/,10.31224/osf.io/94wfg,10.1016/j.esd.2016.03.006,2019-04-03T23:48:49.998476,2019-04-04T18:27:33.991453
v83k5,"Impacts of Engineering Justice Curriculum: A Survey of Student Attitudes","As part of a larger project examining the role of humanitarian service learning in engineering (NSF project number EEC-1540301), we conducted an investigation of first-year engineering students' perceptions of humanitarian service learning projects, social responsibility in their discipline, and ethics in STEM. Students (n=231) taking a required freshmen level engineering course were surveyed with a pre- and post-instrument, and provided with these working definitions:  

* Community Service is voluntary work intended to help people in a particular community. 
* Social Responsibility is an obligation that an individual (or company) has to act with concern and sensitivity, aware of the impacts of their own action on others, particularly the disadvantaged. 
* Social Justice relates to the distribution of the advantages and disadvantages in society, including the way in which they are allocated. 
* Pro bono- work done without compensation (pay) for the public good. 

This course specifically addresses the issues described above with the goal of providing early exposure to topics that will be reinforced in non-major coursework, such as general education elective courses. Results showed that there was little change in student perceptions before and after completion of the course in terms of their perceptions of ethics, social responsibility, and social justice. In the areas in which there were statistically significant changes, students were, on average, slightly less sure the engineering profession can help people or solve social issues and slightly less interested in a job that involves helping people. On the other hand, students were slightly more aware, after the course, of the need to include social aspects in engineering practice and rated technical and professional skills as slightly less important after the class. It was also found that some groups in the class (women, minority students, first-generation students, and student less focused on salary in thinking about their future jobs) entered the class with different attitudes and changed in different ways by the end of the course. Overall, the results of this survey support other findings in engineering ethics which suggests that one course is insufficient to make significant impacts on the ways engineering students think about the societal implications of their work. However, these declines in student confidence, while small, are important to take seriously and this paper will draw out potential implications of this finding. Finally, we will discuss the implications of the differences within the class in terms of effective teaching of these topics and retention of underrepresented students.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ca4ce1cf77305001a3b576f/,426,https://engrxiv.org/v83k5/,10.31224/osf.io/v83k5,,2019-04-03T15:20:12.092736,2019-04-03T18:03:47.983228

In this approach, instead of explicitly representing the detailed pore geometry, we use homogenization but maintain some information about the microstructure (porosity) in the model. Porosity is introduced in the model as initial peridynamic damage, implemented by stochastically pre-breaking peridynamic bonds to match the desired porosity value. We validate the model for elastodynamics with wave propagation in porous glasses, where we match observed wave propagation speeds and the apparent elastic moduli for various porosities. The model is then used to study the fracture behavior of Berea sandstone under three-point bending loading conditions. We validate the model for fracture problems using the case of failure in a sandstone sample with an off-center pre-notch under three-point bending. The IH-PD results agree very well with experiments: we obtain different failure modes depending on the length of the off-center pre-notch. When the pre-notch is short, most damage (and the subsequent failure) happens in the center of the beam (largest tensile stresses in an un-notched sample). In this case, material porosity makes the fracture behavior “insensitive” to the presence of the off-center pre-notch. When the pre-notch is long, damage starts from near its tip, and progresses in mixed mode towards the loading point. The model captures the location of crack initiation to be the right-corner of the notch, exactly as shown by the experimental acoustic emission results. A fully-homogenized model for the porous sandstone fails to reproduce the failure mode sensitivity on the pre-notch length. The results show the importance of using the IH-PD model when trying to capture the important effects local heterogeneities (like pores) have on damage initiation and growth in porous materials.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ca401e4c25afd001cdde63d/,1101,https://engrxiv.org/85svm/,10.31224/osf.io/85svm,10.1016/j.ijrmms.2019.104059,2019-04-03T00:53:57.619507,2020-07-25T17:34:56.662814
gz3db,"The Effect of Working Fluids on Premixed Hydrogen Combustion in a Constant Volume Combustion Chamber","Premixed combustion of hydrogen was investigated with the purpose of examining the effect of the full or partial substitution of argon for nitrogen in air on laminar burning velocity. Theoretically, this partial replacement decreases the NOx emissions and increases the thermal efficiency of internal combustion engines due to the high specific heat ratio of noble gases. An optically-accessible constant volume combustion chamber (CVCC) with central ignition was used to study flame propagation, flame morphological structure, and instability. The spherical flame development was studied using a high-speed Z-type Schlieren visualization system. Moreover, a numerical model was developed to convert the pressure rise data to laminar burning velocity. Coupling the model to a chemical equilibrium code aids in determining the burned gas properties. The experimental and numerical investigations indicate that increasing the concentration of argon as the working fluid in the mixture can increase the laminar burning velocity and extend the lean flammability limit.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ca2546705597c001ae1bf10/,598,https://engrxiv.org/gz3db/,10.31224/osf.io/gz3db,,2019-04-01T18:14:18.990028,2019-08-05T17:50:48.371741
ebvah,"Numerical Study on Direct Injection of Hydrogen-Methane Blends into a Constant Volume Combustion Chamber","Natural gas is not commonly used in compression ignition cycles due to difficulty in achieving autoignition conditions. The addition of hydrogen to natural gas can help overcome this issue considering hydrogen’s flammability range and ability to autoignite. In this computational study, the turbulent injection of hydrogen-methane mixtures with varied composition of the gaseous fuels into a constant volume combustion chamber has been modeled. All conditions including injection pressure, initial chamber temperature, and initial chamber pressure are kept constant; the jet properties and combustion characteristics were then investigated. The results indicate that adding hydrogen to methane drastically shortens the ignition delay, enables the system to run at a lower initial temperature, and provides appropriate conditions for the compression ignition of the gaseous fuel. Increasing the volume fraction of hydrogen in the mixture strongly affects the spray tip penetration length and cone angle, while altering the mixing rate of the injected fuel with air. The mixtures with higher hydrogen volume fractions penetrate more during the early stages of injection. However, the higher momentum of the mixtures with more methane compensates for this effect when the jet disperses significantly in the chamber.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ca252de0a13d7001a8b895b/,688,https://engrxiv.org/ebvah/,10.31224/osf.io/ebvah,,2019-04-01T18:08:53.486186,2019-04-11T18:12:36.387796
gdzcw,"Assessment of Mental Stress Using EEG and fNIRS Features","Stress is a major contributing factor to chronical disorders and productivity loss. Students spend most of their time studying, often burdened with high workloads and time pressure, a factors that contribute to increase the level of stress and decrease their academic performance. Stress activates the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical axis and the sympathetic nervous system leading to the release of stress hormone (cortisol) in the adrenal cortex. The continuous release of cortisol leads to several chronical diseases including anxiety, depression, stroke and even addiction. Therefore, an accurate stress detection method at its early stage is very important to clinical intervention, diseases prevention as well as for academic performance. While different neuroimaging modalities have been proposed to detect mental stress, each modality experiences certain limitations. Neuroimaging tools such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) have good spatial resolution, yet are limited in terms of temporal resolution and susceptibility to motion artifacts. They also require the test subjects to remain at fixed position during scanning. Electroencephalography (EEG) constitutes a possible alternative neuroimaging technique that does not possess the same limitations. The EEG has temporal resolution in the order of a few milliseconds, which makes it suitable for measuring cortical changes during workplace activities. However, the EEG is generally considered as having poor spatial resolution (compare to excellent fMRI modality) and being highly prone to motion artifacts. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has allowed human cortical activity to be measured during unconstrained movements, the temporal resolution is sub-second, and the spatial resolution is on order of 1 cm2 at best. In order to overcome these constraints, it is advisable to combine the EEG with fNIRS modality to provide a complementary nature and improve the detection rate of mental stress.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ca22fc0ecd788001798e27c/,523,https://engrxiv.org/gdzcw/,10.31224/osf.io/gdzcw,,2019-04-01T15:42:05.094465,2019-04-01T15:49:04.355673

jg27s,"The shear buckling and postbuckling behavior of laterally pressured curved panels","Curved panels are widely used in different structures from fuselage of planes to curved bridge girders. An accurate understanding of buckling and postbuckling behavior of curved panels under different loadings is essential for efficient structural design. The shear buckling and postbuckling behavior of laterally pressured thin curved panels under gradually increasing in-plane shear forces is investigated. The magnitude of the lateral forces, the radius of curvature and the aspect ratio of panels are considered in the parametric studies. A classic theoretical formulation of curved panels buckling load is reexamined and compared to experimental results. The results showed that inward pressure eliminates the snap-through phenomenon and the softening stage in the response of shallow curved panels. However, the buckling characteristics are not significantly affected in the moderately curved panels under small pressures. In addition, the magnitude of inward pressures that would affect the shear buckling and postbuckling behavior of panels depends on their radius of curvature. The ultimate shear capacity of a highly curved panel is considerably reduced due to the increasing presence of inward pressures. The failure mode of highly curved panels are associated with the occurrence of unstable buckling; and as a result, the released strain energy prevents the occurrence of hardening stages.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c9e2eec06cd47001a5a7bbd/,427,https://engrxiv.org/jg27s/,10.31224/osf.io/jg27s,,2019-03-29T14:53:30.286540,2019-04-11T18:24:23.491246

road transport industry with little or no regulatory control of its operations, usually characterised by unplanned and ad-hoc service delivery. The notoriously dangerous informal transport industry in South Africa – dominated by minibus taxis – has been shown to disregard the posted speed limit on long-distance trips. Not only do they frequently exceed the differentiated speed limit imposed on minibus taxis, but also the speed limit imposed on normal passenger vehicles. This paper evaluates the impact of an auditory Intelligent Speed Adaptation (ISA) intervention, applied at various intensity levels, on the speeding behaviour of this seemingly intransigent mode of transport. The experiment evaluates the behaviour on the R61 between Beaufort West and Aberdeen. We evaluate the speeding distributions, speeding frequencies, speed percentiles, mean speeds, and the statistical relevance of key metrics. We find that the auditory intervention has a clear impact on speeding behaviour, both when applied
at an audible level that can be drowned out by a radio, and
even greater impact at a loud level. The impact on speeding
is significant, with speeding frequency (both time and distance) reducing by over 20 percentage points.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c9c80c2e0a7de0019949130/,426,https://engrxiv.org/9cb4d/,10.31224/osf.io/9cb4d,10.1109/MITS.2016.2533979,2019-03-28T08:12:02.187098,2019-03-28T13:12:47.348796

In construction, one of the critical elements carrying a high percentage of the weight is columns which were not used to design to absorb large dynamic load like surface bursts. This study focuses on investigating blast load parameters to design more resistant RC columns to blast loads. The numerical model is based on finite element analysis (FEA) using LS-DYNA. Numerical results are validated against blast field tests available online. Couples of simulations are performed with changing blast parameters to study effects of various scaled distances on the nonlinear behavior of RC columns. According to simulation results, the scaled distance has a substantial impact on the blast response of RC columns. With lower scaled distance, higher peak pressure and larger pressure impulse are applied on the RC column. Eventually, keeping the scaled distance unchanged, increasing the charge weight or shorter standoff distance cause more damage to the RC column. Intensive studies are carried out to investigate the effects of scaled distance and charge weight on the damage degree and residual axial load carrying capacity of RC columns with various column width, longitudinal reinforcement ratio and concrete strength. Results of this research will be used to assessment the effect of an explosion on the dynamic behavior of RC columns.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c9a265bf718460019b44f72/,441,https://engrxiv.org/6n5fs/,10.31224/osf.io/6n5fs,,2019-03-26T14:19:57.629309,2020-07-16T13:32:07.321235

result of the undeniable need to mitigate the effects of environmental pollution and assist the economic development of countries around the globe. However, due to the lack of rotational inertia and their intermittent nature, renewables have also increased the severity of the occurring disturbances and instability phenomena, which in turn place a demand for more accurate modeling of the network and the power system components. In this paper, we propose a novel network formulation for AC microgrids that allows the consideration of less conservative conditions for the network, while allowing the adoption of higher order inverter-based generation dynamics

In particular, we formulate the network as a dynamical multi-input/multi-output system, which we show is both stable and passive, even if the network’s dynamic and lossy nature is taken into account. We then briefly discuss the opportunities and the advantages offered by the proposed approach and provide useful guidelines for a more accurate modeling of power system components.

The novelty in the IH-PD model here is accounting for the topology of the fiber-phase in the transverse sample loading via a calibration to the Halpin-Tsai model. Both models can capture well the measured load-displacement behavior observed experimentally for intraply fracture, without the need for an explicit representation of microstructure geometry of the FRC. The IH-PD model, however, is more accurate and produces crack path tortuosity as well as a non-monotonic load-crack-opening softening curve, similar to what is observed experimentally. These benefits come from the preservation of some micro-scale heterogeneity, stochastically generated in the IH-PD model to match the composite’s fiber volume fraction, while its computational cost is equivalent to that of an FH-PD model. We also present a three-point bending transverse loading case in which the two models lead to dramatically different failure modes: the FH-PD model shows that failure always starts from the off-center pre-notch, while the IH-PD model, when the pre-notch is sufficiently off-center, finds that the composite fails from the center of the sample, not from the pre-notch.

486jh,"Turbulent theory of velocity-profile-induced jet breakup","Velocity profile relaxation is commonly believed to be a cause of jet breakup. This claim is critically reevaluated in this work. Contrary to common belief, laminar liquid jets with parabolic velocity profiles are actually more stable than laminar jets with flatter velocity profiles. This is shown using prior theory and experiments. For turbulent jets, the influence of the velocity profile is more difficult to determine. Previous experimentalists claimed to show that the velocity profile has an effect by varying the nozzle length. The claim is that the boundary layer thickness grows with nozzle length, and that the larger the boundary layer, the less stable the jet. In this work, nozzle length is shown to be a poor proxy for velocity profile effects because the turbulence intensity also increases as the nozzle length increases. Studies with this confounding were ignored in this work. Thinner boundary layers have greater shear, yet experiments have shown that if the boundary layer were made thinner (all else constant), the jet often is more stable. This is termed the ""shear paradox"". A potential resolution to the shear paradox is developed by considering that the area with shear also decreases as the boundary layer thickness is decreased, and by non-dimensionalizing the turbulent production rate by the dissipation. This theory shows an interaction between the integral scale and velocity profile relaxation which has not been previously discussed. The theoretical prediction that a smaller integral scale leads to more stable jets (due to increased turbulent dissipation) is shown to be somewhat consistent with the limited experimental and DNS data available.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c9558807d67be0016711f2c/,802,https://engrxiv.org/486jh/,10.31224/osf.io/486jh,,2019-03-22T21:52:14.446559,2020-01-04T20:55:41.825237
k2fnm,"Improving the validation of turbulent jet breakup models","Understanding the physics of the breakup of turbulent liquid jets is important for a variety of applications including engine sprays, fire suppression systems, and water jet cutting. Models of turbulent jet breakup allow predictions of quantities of interest like the droplet size distribution and breakup length of the jet. These models are compared against experimental data in a process called validation. If the model predictions are within the experimental uncertainty, then the model is ""validated"" and believed to be accurate, and possibly can explain the physics. Uncertainty quantification is necessary for model validation. While unfortunately relatively few experimental studies quantify uncertainty, that is not the most pressing validation issue in turbulent jet breakup. I detail 3 additional problems that can make the apparent validation of a model actually an illusion, regardless of how well the model appears to match the data. These problems include: 1. important variables being omitted or guessed in experiments and models, 2. confounding between independent variables, that is, two variables changing simultaneously, making determining cause and effect impossible, and 3. testing only combinations of submodels and not each submodel in isolation.

fs3qk,"Efficient Production of Acetic Acid from Nipa (Nypa fruticans) Sap by Moorella thermoacetica (f. Clostridium thermoaceticum)","To valorize the underutilized nipa sap composed mainly of sucrose, glucose and fructose, acetic acid fermentation by Moorella thermoacetica was explored. Given that M. thermoacetica cannot directly metabolize sucrose, we evaluated various catalysts for the hydrolysis of this material. Oxalic acid and invertase exhibited high levels of activity towards the hydrolysis of  the sucrose in nipa sap to glucose and fructose. Although these two methods consumed similar levels of energy for the hydrolysis of sucrose, oxalic acid was found to be more cost-effective. Nipa saps hydrolyzed by these two catalysts were also fermented by M. thermoacetica. The results revealed that the two hydrolyzed sap mixtures gave 10.0 g/L of acetic acid from the 10.2 g/L of substrate sugars in nipa sap. Notably, the results showed that the oxalic acid catalyst was also fermented to acetic acid, which avoided the need to remove the catalyst from the product stream. Taken together, these results show that oxalic acid hydrolysis is superior to enzymatic hydrolysis for the pretreatment of nipa sap. The acetic acid yield achieved in this study corresponds to a conversion efficiency of 98%, which is about 3.6 times higher than that achieved using the traditional methods. The process developed in this study therefore has high potential as a green biorefinery process for the efficient conversion of sucrose-containing nipa sap to bio-derived acetic acid.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c94531eb239680018170e20/,540,https://engrxiv.org/fs3qk/,10.31224/osf.io/fs3qk,,2019-03-22T03:17:41.656570,2019-03-22T13:45:10.348303

muj72,"Impact damage detection in fiberglass composites using low acoustic impedance-based PZT transducers","The objective of this work is to evaluate the ability of a lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) transducer to detect the damages caused by the impacts in fiberglass-epoxy composites.  Impacts were created by a hammer (unquantified energy) and an automatic impact system (quantified energy) in multiple composite sheets. The mechanism of damage detection relies on the impedance measurement by a low acoustic impedance (LAI) transducer which resonates in the radial mode rather than the regular thickness mode. The effect of surface roughness was investigated by making specimens with different quantified surface roughness values. It was shown that the surface roughness and boundary conditions are affecting the results of the experiments in the case of very rough surface and hard boundary conditions. The main body of this study was testing the setup on the composite sheets. The specimens were tested for an energy range of 10 to 54 joules. The surface of each specimen was gridded with a step size of 5 mm and the impedance was measured for each location. The results were normalized versus to a situation that the transducer was not in contact with any load. It was shown that the proposed portable and easy-to-use LAI setup could detect the damages qualitatively. The normalized measured impedance was variable, but it showed a significant increase, in some cases as high as 100%, on the impact’s region.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c8ec8c618184e0016c378da/,412,https://engrxiv.org/muj72/,10.31224/osf.io/muj72,,2019-03-18T20:00:15.217257,2019-09-11T16:24:54.794874

d3em6,"APPLICATIONS OF A “GEOMETRICAL SOUNDNESS EQUATION” FOR SUPERADOBE DOMES","A Superadobe dome is a parameterization in the sense that given some initial parameters, the structure can be
completely determined by them [1]. While a set of such initial parameters can produce a safe and functional structure, a different
set can result in an unsafe, unstable, or even geometrically senseless structure.
It is necessary for a Superadobe designer to predict the structure’s final dimensions and mechanical behavior from the initial
parameters of his or her choice, so as to be able to choose them wisely. These initial independent numbers must satisfy some equations
containing variables of both geometrical and mechanical nature, yet the parameters’ compliance with the single, purely-geometrical

ptq47,"EQUATIONS THAT DESCRIBE THE GEOMETRY OF SUPERADOBE DOMED STRUCTURES","""Superadobe"" is a method for the construction of self-built shelters that has three main advantages: It’s economical, it’s easy to execute by common people, and produces buildings with good structural behavior against natural events such as earthquakes, floods, fire and high winds [1]. It consists in filling polypropylene sacks with a moist mixture of clay, sand, gravel and lime/cement; placing and compacting one on top of another in the form of concentric rings of decreasing radii and describing a double curvature monolith. (Similar to a paraboloid).
The construction of these domed monoliths follow a simple geometrical pattern based on the use of compasses, hence the form, and other building characteristics can be parametric. This is, a system of equations for these building’s physical dimensions can be derived, based on initial parameters.
These equation’s variables can be divided into independent ('constructive') and dependent ('observable'), and by defining the values of the independent parameters (sack dimensions, radius of base (internal compass), radius of roof (external compass), radius of skylight, dimensions of openings, mean material specific weight, mean material elastic modulus, mean friction coefficient between rows, etc.), resulting dimensions and mechanical behaviors, such as building height, interior habitable area, proportion of rows that rest upon the previous, or total building weight, maximum shear force amongst all rows, axial stresses, etc. can be determined.
This article deals with the resulting geometrical dimensions of the building, given corresponding initial parameters. If we were to set some dependent variables as fixed values, we could solve the system of equations for the missing independent parameters. This would allow for example, to set design values for building weight and height, and to determine the unknown values for the corresponding radiuses and necessary sack dimensions which will produce a building that meets this pre requisites.

Conventional Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) techniques, especially ultrasonic testing, are not always suitable for detecting these types of defect, especially in thin plates. The proposed NDT method in this article employs Low Acoustic Impedance (LAI) characterization. The novelty of LAI technique lies in the transverse resonating of Lead-Zirconate-Titanate (PZT) transducer which shows significant lower effective acoustic impedance compared to thickness - extension mode. The LAI technique eliminates the need for the matching layers and reduces the manufacturing cost consequently. Briefly, the analytical model has been introduced and the fabrication procedure has been discussed in detail. The setup has been evaluated both numerically and experimentally to detect a debonding.

mp7bq,"Damage Detection in Composites by LAI-PZT Transducer","Composite structures are known for being susceptible to manufacturing defects and
in-service damage. Since damage in composites is not always visually apparent, Non-
Destructive Techniques (NDT) such as ultrasonic imaging are often employed to detect and
quantify damage [1]. Materials such as carbon-epoxy and fiberglass-epoxy plates are
frequently used as structural elements in the both the civil and aerospace industry. Structure
made of these materials display high acoustic impedances along the direction of the fibers but
behave as Low Acoustic Impedance (LAI) materials in the transverse direction (i.e., through
the composite’s thickness). It follows that LAI acoustic transducer are generally more
appropriate to scan and detect damage/defects through the thickness in various types of
anisotropic structures. When transducers are coupled in a direction orthogonal to the resonant
mode they display significantly lower characteristic impedance than if coupled in the same
direction. In some cases, this feature can eliminate the need for intermediate “matching”
films and makes LAI transducer desirable for acoustic imaging applications. In this paper we
introduce the use of low-cost, low effective impedance PZT transducer for damage detection
in LAI structures. This manuscript also describes results from both numerical modeling and
damage detection testing performed using a prototype transducer. In the future simple and
economical transducers resonated in their transverse mode rather than the thickness mode
could be used to detect damage such as matrix cracking and delamination of the composite

Three different cases have been investigated using geometry of a microchanel heat sink selected from experimental work in the literature. The constraints considered in this study, are fixed channel height and maximum pressure drop. It has been observed that with fixed channel height constraint, while the aspect ratio changes from 1 to 10, the optimum operating condition fall in the range of Reynolds number equal to 2000 and aspect ratio of 2.25. Moreover, the extra constrain on maximum pressure drop imposes a limitation on applicable aspect ratio range. The maximum aspect ratio of the channel for stable flow field in this case cannot be higher than 5 imposed by criteria of laminar flow regime. The obtained optimum values are Reynolds number of 1850 and aspect ratio of 2.

However, such strategies are usually hampered by optical aberrations caused by the imaging system and tissue turbidity. State-of-the-art aberration correction methods require that the light signal be phase stable over the full-field data acquisition period, which is difficult to maintain during dynamic cellular processes in vivo. Here we show that any optical aberrations in the path length difference (OPD) domain can be corrected without the phase stability requirement based on maximum intensity assumption. Specifically, we demonstrate a novel optical tomographic technique, termed amplitude division aperture synthesis optical coherence tomography (ADAS-OCT), which corrects aberrations induced by turbid tissues by physical aperture synthesis and simultaneously data acquisition from sub-apertures. Even with just two sub-apertures, ADAS-OCT enabled in vivo visualization of red blood cells in human labial mucosa. We further demonstrated that adding sub-apertures could significantly scale up the aberration correction capability. This technology has the potential to impact a number of clinical areas where noninvasive examinations are preferred, such as blood count and cancers detection.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c84aa20245c0a0017d28485/,612,https://engrxiv.org/h4wrv/,10.31224/osf.io/h4wrv,,2019-03-10T06:21:28.005656,2019-03-11T14:50:47.329178

Deep neural networks have shown to be very powerful to learn the non-linear patterns in the data. While a deep learning approach attempts to learn complex pattern related to the presence of AF in the ECG, they can benefit from knowing which parts of the signal is more important to focus during learning. In this paper, we introduce a two-channel deep neural network to more accurately detect AF presented in the ECG signal. The first channel takes in a preprocessed ECG signal and automatically learns where to attend for detection of AF. The second channel simultaneously takes in the preprocessed ECG signal to consider all features of entire signals. The model shows via visualization that what parts of the given ECG signal are important to attend while trying to detect atrial fibrillation.

mqwdb,"Impacts of Engineering: An Introductory Course in Engineering Featuring Social Justice","Impacts of Engineering is a three-credit required course for all incoming engineering freshmen and is also available as a general education elective to all university students. The course was developed to address the needs of new engineering students while setting the stage for how they might approach engineering work in later curriculum. Prior to the development of this course, engineering students at UW-Stout were exposed to the topics of ethics, social justice, and social responsibility solely through general education electives and through limited discussion in capstone courses. In addition, there is a selection of ``extra-curricular'' opportunities for student engagement, most notably a chapter of Engineers Without Borders USA, however these opportunities don’t carry curricular integration. The first effort at more directly integrating these topics into the engineering curriculum was through the development of a new course called ``Impacts of Engineering,'' which is described in the course documentation as shown in the following section.

pgkqz,"Optimization of Hybrid Learning Approach for Power Electronics Course Using Virtual Laboratory to Prepare Teachers in Industry 4.0","Many challenges need to be addressed in facing the Industry 4.0 (I4.0), especially for teachers in schools or colleges. One of them is how to adapt a learning process with I4.0 where computers and technologies play an important role. A hybrid learning approach using a virtual laboratory could be the answer to this problem. Hybrid learning combines face-to-face learning, e-learning, virtual laboratory and practice in a laboratory. It could optimize the advantages of all methods and introduce educational technology to students. Furthermore, it will prepare the vocational teacher candidates in facing the I4.0. This paper
focuses on developing, implementing and optimizing a power electronic course for vocational students with a hybrid learning approach using a virtual laboratory in Universitas Negeri Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The hybrid learning approach is validated by experts from electrical engineering education using an assessment method and analyzed by means statistically. The result shows that the hybrid learning approach by using virtual laboratory can be adopted for improving the analytical thinking skills
in solving power electronics problems for students as a vocational teacher candidate.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c7d6dc8ff4a89001b24b113/,434,https://engrxiv.org/pgkqz/,10.31224/osf.io/pgkqz,,2019-03-04T18:34:28.517726,2019-03-11T17:52:44.131302
fsa3c,"Ultrasound Segmentation of Cervical Muscle during head motion: a Dataset and a Benchmark using Deconvolutional Neural Networks","Objectives: To automate online segmentation of cervical muscles from transverse ultrasound (US) images of the human neck during functional head movement. To extend ground-truth labelling methodology beyond dependence upon MRI imaging of static head positions required for application to participants with involuntary movement disorders. Method: We collected sustained sequences (&gt; 3 minutes) of US images of human posterior cervical neck muscles at 25 fps from 28 healthy adults, performing visually-guided pitch and yaw head motions. We sampled 1,100 frames (approx. 40 per participant) spanning the experimental range of head motion. We manually labelled all 1,100 US images and trained deconvolutional neural networks (DCNN) with a spatial SoftMax regression layer to classify every pixel in the full resolution (525x491) US images, as one of 14 classes (10 muscles, ligamentum nuchae, vertebra, skin, background). We investigated ‘MaxOut’ and Exponential Linear unit (ELU) transfer functions and compared with our previous benchmark (analytical shape modelling). Results: These DCNNs showed higher Jaccard Index (53.2%) and lower Hausdorff Distance (5.7 mm) than the previous benchmark (40.5%, 6.2 mm). SoftMax Confidence corresponded with correct classification. ‘MaxOut’ outperformed ELU marginally. Conclusion: The DCNN architecture accommodates challenging images and imperfect manual labels. The SoftMax layer gives user feedback of likely correct classification. The ‘MaxOut’ transfer function benefits from near-linear operation, compatibility with deconvolution operations and the dropout regulariser. Significance: This methodology for labelling ground-truth and training automated labelling networks is applicable for dynamic segmentation of moving muscles and for participants with involuntary movement disorders who cannot remain still.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c75c9c362c82a0019dca6a4/,809,https://engrxiv.org/fsa3c/,10.31224/osf.io/fsa3c,,2019-02-26T23:24:40.612314,2019-03-26T20:09:15.796507

For Malaysia, it is not cost effective to use cutting edge TWS. The reason is it free from big earthquakes where its location far from tectonic plate boundaries. Besides, it’s surrounded by neighbouring countries which act like natural wall to prevent natural disaster reach to Malaysia territory. Fatal Tsunami happened on 2004 has changed this fact and Malaysia is exposed to secondary effect of natural disaster happened at neighbouring countries. An earthquake with magnitude nine (9) occurred at Banda Aceh was generate Tsunami wave that propagate from Indonesia to Malaysia coastline killed 68 people.

EWH models serve as a step towards achieving optimised control, and can also be used to inform users of expected savings due to changes, if the model is energy-based. Various models have been proposed, but none of them include more than half of the six key features that the model presented in this paper supports: horizontal orientation; schedule control; low computational complexity; validation of the model; multinodal stratification; and multinodal standing losses. The presented model is validated against six datasets: four comprising 900 hours with multiple water usage events; and two with only standing losses. The results show that the model estimates energy consumption over ten days including usage with an error of less than 2% and 5% for schedule control and thermostat control respectively.

9x6df,"Estimating PV Power from Aggregate Power Measurements within the Distribution Grid","The increased integration of photovoltaic (PV) systems in distribution grids reduces visibility and situational awareness for utilities, because the PV systems’ power production is usually not monitored by them. To address this problem, a method called Contextually Supervised Source Separation (CSSS) has been recently adapted for real-time estimation of aggregate PV active power generation from aggregate net active and reactive power measurements at a point in a radially configured distribution grid (e.g., substation). In its original version, PV disaggregation is formulated as an optimization problem that fits linear regression models for the aggregate PV active power generation and true substation active power load. This paper extends the previous work by adding regularization terms in the objective function to capture additional contextual information such as smoothness, by adding new constraints, by introducing new regressors such as ambient temperature, and by investigating the use of time-varying regressors. Furthermore, we perform extensive parametric analysis to inform tuning of the objective function weighting factors in a way that maximizes performance and robustness. The proposed PV disaggregation method can be applied to networks with either a single PV system (e.g., MW scale) or many distributed ones (e.g., residential scale) connected downstream of the substation. Simulation studies with real field recorded data show that the enhancements of the proposed method reduce disaggregation error by 58% in winter and 35% in summer compared with previous CSSS-based work. When compared against a commonly used transposition model based approach, the reduction in disaggregation error is more pronounced (78% reduction in winter and 45% in summer). Additional simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm is applicable also for PV systems with time-varying power factors. Overall, our results show that – with appropriate modeling and tuning – it is possible to accurately estimate the aggregated PV active power generation of a distribution feeder with minimal or no additional sensor deployment.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6d402762c82a0017d799c6/,808,https://engrxiv.org/9x6df/,10.31224/osf.io/9x6df,,2019-02-20T12:03:49.316529,2020-07-09T13:10:00.398111
pyq29,"Indirect 3D bioprinting and characterization of alginate scaffolds for potential nerve tissue engineering applications","Low-concentration hydrogels have favorable properties for many cell functions in tissue engineering but are considerably limited from a scaffold fabrication point of view due to poor three-dimensional (3D) printability. Here, we developed an indirect-bioprinting process for alginate scaffolds and characterized the potential of these scaffolds for nerve tissue engineering applications. The indirect-bioprinting process involves (1) printing a sacrificial framework from gelatin, (2) impregnating the framework with low-concentration alginate, and (3) removing the gelatin framework by an incubation process, thus forming low-concentration alginate scaffolds. The scaffolds were characterized by compression testing, swelling, degradation, and morphological and biological assessment of incorporated or seeded Schwann cells. For comparison, varying concentrations of alginate scaffolds (from 0.5 to 3%) were fabricated and sterilized using either ultraviolet light or ethanol. Results indicated that scaffolds can be fabricated using the indirect-bioprinting process, wherein the scaffold properties are affected by the concentration of alginate and sterilization technique used. These factors provide effective means of regulating the properties of scaffolds fabricated using the indirect-bioprinting process. Cell-incorporated scaffolds demonstrated better cell viability than bulk gels. In addition, scaffolds showed better cell functionality when fabricated with a lower concentration of alginate compared to a higher concentration. The indirect-bioprinting process that we implemented could be extended to other types of low-concentration hydrogels to address the tradeoffs between printability and properties for favorable cell functions.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6ad9521650690018109d57/,489,https://engrxiv.org/pyq29/,10.31224/osf.io/pyq29,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2019.02.014,2019-02-18T16:21:42.635544,2020-07-08T15:55:02.657883

Though some research groups have pursued methods that involve submerging the transducer and imaged body segment into a water bath, many limitations remain in regards to acquiring an unloaded volumetric image of an entire human limb in a fast, safe and adequately accurate manner. A 3D dataset of a limb is useful in several rehabilitative applications including biomechanical modeling of soft tissue, prosthetic socket design, monitoring muscle condition and disease progression, bone health, and orthopedic surgery. This paper builds on previous work from our group and presents the design, prototyping, and preliminary testing of a novel multi- modal imaging system for rapidly acquiring volumetric ultrasound imagery of human limbs, with a particular focus on residual limbs for improved prosthesis design. Our system employs a mecha- nized water tank setup to scan a limb with a clinical ultrasound transducer, and 3D optical imagery to track motion during a scan. The iterative closest point algorithm is utilized to compensate for motion and stitch the images into a final dataset. The results show preliminary 2D and 3D imaging of both a tissue-mimicking phantom and residual limbs. A volumetric error compares the ultrasound image data obtained to a previous MRI method.

Very few studies have explored the specific demand characteristics of apartments, which house a growing proportion of the global urban population. 
We present a study of apartment electricity loads, using a dataset containing a year of half-hourly electricity data for 6000 Australian households, to examine the relationship between dwelling type, demographic characteristics and load profile. The focus on apartments, combined with the size of the data set, and the representative seasonal load profiles obtained through clustering full annual profiles, is unique in the literature. We find that median per-occupant household electricity use is 21% lower for apartments than for houses and that, on average, apartments have lower load factor and higher daily load variability, and show greater diversity in their daily peak times, resulting in a lower coincidence factor for aggregations of apartment loads. Using cluster analysis and classification, we also show the impact of dwelling type on the shape of household electricity load profiles.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c52a24704d9bb001a7fcb2f/,705,https://engrxiv.org/2aurb/,10.31224/osf.io/2aurb,10.1016/j.energy.2019.04.222,2019-01-31T07:27:56.850841,2019-05-21T12:36:28.110387
p6uc8,"Experimental detection of debonding of piezoelectric sensors with the segmented electrode","The piezoelectric transducers (PZT) are bonded to smart structures by means of an intermediate adhesive layer, with the main objectives of applying methodologies of structural health monitoring, nondestructive evaluation, nondestructive inspection and structural control to the structures. However, the application of these methodologies depends on the health of the adhesive joint that couples mechanically the PZT with the structure. This research shows an experimental technique based on the segmentation of electrodes of a PZT patch in sheet form. One electrode is segmented in three equal parts (end left, middle and end right) to obtain three electrical signatures of a PZT. The electrical signatures (voltage) of the end electrodes are related to the middle electrode voltage. Three experiments were carried out in this study: two static cases and one dynamic case. For the static case, the left end (first case) and the right end (first case) were debonded. In the dynamic case, only one side was debonded. The results show that the voltage relations present linear behavior and the changing in the slope of the voltage ratio allows identifying which electrode is debonded. This technique showed to be effective in the three studied cases of debonding and it could be used to identify debonding in real time",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c501db3568329001c7f9987/,303,https://engrxiv.org/p6uc8/,10.31224/osf.io/p6uc8,10.13140/RG.2.1.1610.2160,2019-01-29T09:39:45.060569,2019-01-29T15:55:41.534603
b6k4f,"Comparing fast neutron transport calculations using code package KATRIN-2.0 for various options of VVER-440 core setup","Calculation of radiation exposure for VVER reactor vessel is a key task for the following determination of their burn-up life. This problem is especially topical for VVER-440 reactors of the first generation which now require substantiation report of safe operation over-designed service life. The estimation of radiation exposure of the reactor vessel involves the calculation of fast neutron fluence (E≥0.5 MeV) on welded joints and basis metal of the reactor vessel. The result of neutron fluence calculation and the associated estimation error are affected by the precision of fission neutron source definition in the reactor core. This study examines two approaches to defining fission neutron source in the fuel assembly: specifically, assembly-wise distribution, as well as rod-wise distribution approaches.
The main objective of this work is to characterize the difference in calculation results of neutron fluence (E≥0.5
MeV) on the VVER-440 reactor vessel at rod-wise and assembly-wise definition of the fission neutron source in
peripheral fuel assemblies, and to estimate the accuracy of fluence calculation for each source definition method, by
comparing them with some experimental data.

Such environments are pertinent to oxy-coal combustion, a promising “clean-coal” technology. The replacement of the inert nitrogen gas in air with carbon dioxide, which has different physical properties, alters the combustion conditions in the furnace. Hence, the purpose of this
work is to theoretically examine the effects of (a) the oxygen concentration in the O2/CO2 gases,
and (b) the resulting combustion temperatures, on the evolution of NOx. To achieve these goals a
previously published kinetic model was used, which assumes that fuel-bound nitrogen is released
along with the tars during coal devolatilization and converts mostly to hydrogen cyanide. A sizable fraction of hydrogen cyanide is then converted to NO. Flame simulations were performed using Cantera to investigate the relative impacts of temperature and oxygen mole fraction, and to understand the causes of the observed trends.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c4e4e160d1c9e00194c1f00/,606,https://engrxiv.org/27mda/,10.31224/osf.io/27mda,,2019-01-28T00:40:30.276192,2020-07-16T21:04:58.758590

The fuel samples chosen for this work are a high-sulfur bituminous coal (Illinois #6), a low-sulfur sub-bituminous coal (Powder River Basin), a herbaceous biomass (corn straw) and a crop-related biomass (rice husk). All fuel samples were burned in a laboratory-scale electrically-heated drop-tube furnace (DTF), operated at 1400 K, and combustion emissions were measured in the furnace effluent. Coal and biomass particles were in the ranges of 75-90 μm and 90-150 μm, respectively.

5atbz,"Non-Invasive Estimation of Domestic Hot Water Usage with Temperature and Vibration Sensors","Electric water heaters are responsible for a large portion of electricity consumption and water usage in the domestic sector. Smart water heaters alleviate the strain on the electricity supply grid and reduce water consumption through behavioural change, but the installation of in-line flow meters is inconvenient and expensive. A non-invasive water flow meter is proposed as an alternative. Non-invasive flow measurement is more common for high flow rates in the industrial sector than for domestic applications. Various non-invasive water measurement methods are investigated in the context of domestic hot water, and a combination of thermal- and vibration-sensing is proposed. The proposed solution uses inexpensive, easily installable, non-invasive sensors and a novel algorithm to provide the same flow measurement accuracy as existing in-line meters. The algorithm detects the beginning and end of water consumption events with an accuracy of 95.6%. Quantitative flow rate estimation was possible for flow rates greater than 5 L min⁻¹ with an accuracy of 89%, while volumetric usage estimation had an accuracy of more than 93%. The algorithm limitations were applied to field data, revealing that water consumption could be detected with an error of less than 12% within the limitations of the proposed algorithm.

Structural Topology Optimisation (STO) is a prevalent optimisation technique used nowadays to reach highly complex and efficient designs (weight-to-stiffness ratio) unable to achieve otherwise. Additive Manufacturing (AM) is a developing manufacturing process which overcomes many of the manufacturing limitations and realises highly optimised products through a layer-based fabrication process. Recent research on reticulated structures proposed using STO and 3D printing to design and fabricate alternative bespoke complex connection designs which have shown its significance through obtaining substantial weight reductions for the same structural capacity. This paper builds on previous research through optimising a single-layer S355 traditional node-connection under four loading cases, producing a state-of-the-art optimised connection design capable of withstanding the four loading cases considered and comparing the results to the traditional ones. In all loading cases, optimised shapes with 46.90% weight reduction were obtained with varying stress levels. A selection of the highly bespoke designs were 3D printed as a proof of concept for the applicability of AM.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c5aa3b9e16f5500188ad22b/,645,https://engrxiv.org/jkexd/,10.31224/osf.io/jkexd,,2019-01-24T21:49:06.487647,2019-01-24T21:49:06.557400

rc8pq,"Use of smart grid technology to compare regions and days of the week in household water heating","Water heating is a leading cause of household energy consumption and, given its capacitive nature, has been the focus of research on demand side management and grid peak load management. Despite all the existing literature on energy for water heating, very little is known about an inextricably linked key determinant of it - demand for hot water and consumption patterns thereof. Moreover, even though water heating energy demand profiles have been investigated in the past, little is known about the different energy profiles for the days of the week, and regional variance of such profiles. This paper measures and reports actual hot water demand acquired through a novel smart metering solution. The different profiles for the days of the week are evaluated, in addition to weekdays and weekend days. Finally, differences between units in peri-rural Mkhondo and the urban Western Cape are compared in terms of water demand, energy demand, and efficiency (energy in vs. energy out). The results show a striking similarity to previous work, with the exception that scheduling has led to energy demand leading water consumption. The results also show that daily routines vary significantly, and also between regions. Surprisingly, the efficiencies and consumption patterns between the regions are also stark, with the urban Western Cape using 20 % more water on an average day, and with 70.2 % efficiency vs. 45.8 % in Mkhondo.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c45886f154ce50016e050c3/,492,https://engrxiv.org/rc8pq/,10.31224/osf.io/rc8pq,10.23919/DUE.2017.7931855,2019-01-21T09:00:12.834629,2020-07-01T12:44:44.041062

ny9df,"Comfort, peak load and energy: Centralised control of water heaters for demand-driven prioritisation","Recent advances in smart grid technology enable new approaches to address the problem of load control for domestic water heating. 
Since water heaters store energy, they are well-suited to load management. 
However, existing approaches have focused on the electrical supply side, ignoring the obvious link between the user and the grid: individual hot water consumption patterns. 
This paper proposes a load spreading approach in which water heaters compete for access to the heating medium. 
The proposed smart grid solution takes grid load limits, real-time temperature measurements, water usage patterns, individual user comfort, and heater meta-data into consideration. 
The scheduler only turns on the heaters with the highest level of need, but limits the number of on heaters to ensure that the grid load stays below a set limit for a set time. 
The method is evaluated by simulation against various heater set temperature levels, and for various load limits, and compared with ripple control and actual consumption measured in a field trial of 34 water heaters. 
The proposed algorithm reduces the load from 62kW to 20, 30, 40, and 50kW (vs. 106kW for full ripple control). The resulting number of unwanted cold events is fewer than for ripple control, and only slightly more than no control, while reducing the total energy by 14% from a user-optimised natural experiment.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c3e41c58047080019fc7308/,521,https://engrxiv.org/ny9df/,10.31224/osf.io/ny9df,10.1016/j.esd.2018.03.006,2019-01-15T20:30:00.778940,2020-07-07T13:00:56.687782

rejcn,"A framework for measuring the time-varying shape and full-field deformation of residual limbs using 3D digital image correlation","Effective prosthetic socket design following lower-limb amputation depends upon the accurate characterization of the shape of the residual limb as well as its volume and shape fluctuations. Objective: This study proposes a novel framework for the measurement and analysis of residual limb shape and deformation, using a high-resolution and low-cost system. Methods: A multi-camera system was designed to capture sets of simultaneous images of the entire residuum surface. The images were analyzed using a specially developed open-source three-dimensional digital image correlation (3D-DIC) toolbox, to obtain the accurate time-varying shapes as well as the full-field deformation and strain maps on the residuum skin surface. Measurements on a transtibial amputee residuum were obtained during knee flexions, muscle contractions, and swelling upon socket removal. Results: It was demonstrated that 3D-DIC can be employed to quantify with high resolution the time-varying residuum shapes, deformations, and strains. Additionally, the enclosed volumes and cross-sectional areas were computed and analyzed. Conclusion: This novel low-cost framework provides a promising solution for the in-vivo evaluation of residuum shapes and strains, as well as the potential for characterizing the mechanical properties of the underlying soft-tissues.

t6zdv,"A new perspective on global renewable energy systems: why trade in energy carriers matters","Recent global modelling studies suggest a decline of long-distance trade in energy carriers in future global renewable energy systems, compared to today’s fossil fuel energy system. In contrast, we identified four crucial drivers that enable trade of renewable energy carriers. These drivers could make trade remain at current levels or even increase during the transition to an energy system with very high shares of renewables. 
First, new land-efficient technologies for renewable fuel production become increasingly available and technically allow for long-distance trade in renewables. Second, regional differences in social acceptance and land availability for energy infrastructure support the development of renewable fuel import and export streams. Third, the economics of renewable energy systems, i.e. the different production conditions globally and the high costs of fully renewable regional electricity systems, will create opportunities for spatial arbitrage. Fourth, the reduction of stranded investments in the fossil fuel sector is possible by switching from fossil fuel to renewable fuel trade in exporting regions.
The impact of these drivers on trade in energy carriers is currently under-investigated by the global energy research community. Therefore, we call for a major research effort in this field, in particular as trade can redistribute profits and losses of climate change mitigation and may hence support finding new partners in climate change mitigation negotiations.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c35e9067cf3f50018b5a11a/,756,https://engrxiv.org/t6zdv/,10.31224/osf.io/t6zdv,,2019-01-09T12:35:55.253573,2019-01-11T17:43:44.450489

3adt5,"Estimation of Mechanical Parameters of Thin Films Using Finite Element Analysis","This study shows a methodology to estimate mechanical parameters of thin films by means of a bulge test and a numerical approach. The methodology is based on the combination of finite element analysis with a  classical analytical method. Finite element modeling was conducted for monolayer (Si3N4) membranes of 2x2mm with the aim to approximate both the load-deflection curves experimentally measured and the classical load-deflection analytical model. Error functions were constructed and minimized to delimit a coupled solution space between Young’s modulus and Poison’s ratio.

qypw4,"Numerical Modeling Approach for the Assessment of Elastic Properties of bi-layer Thin Films Measured by Bulge Test","The present work shows a load-deflection bulge test method to characterize mechanical parameters of thin films by means of a numerical modelling approach. A methodology based on the combination of finite element analysis and classical analytical equations is presented and discussed. Finite element modeling was conducted for monolayer (Si3N4) and bi-layer (Si3N4/Al) membranes with the aim to determine a set of elastic parameters (Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio) which satisfied the load-deflection curves experimentally measured by the bulge test method. It is well known that in a traditional bulge test analysis only biaxial elastic modulus, i.e. a combination of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, can be determined. It is due to the mechanical coupling that exists between the two elastic parameters. However, in this study both mentioned elastic constants can be determined independently through a proposed numerical procedure that includes error functions for minimizing the displacement with a specific set of optimal elastic parameters. Results shows that the estimated Young's modulus (Al 64 GPa and Si3N4 236 GPa) agree with corresponding values determined by other methods in the literature of the studied thin films.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c34cabb7cf3f50019b30e34/,465,https://engrxiv.org/qypw4/,10.31224/osf.io/qypw4,,2019-01-08T16:23:37.174836,2019-01-08T19:33:23.362069
hbj6d,"Optimal operation of renewable energy irrigation system using particle swarm optimization","In rural areas which are located far from the electrical grid, renewable energy systems such as photovoltaic (PV) energy are investigated. The most popular PV application is solar water pumping for irrigation. DC-DC converter and maximum power point tracking are used because the PV modules output varies widely due to varying weather conditions. The water pump is driven by a three phase induction motor through a voltage source inverter (VSI). However, the control of induction motor is known to be difficult because it's highly non-linear and time variant. One method to mitigate this is by using vector control techniques to control the VSI as they offer a number of benefits including speed control and regulation over a wide range and fast dynamic response. The proportional - integral (PI) controller is most commonly used in the speed control loop of vector control. This paper deals with the design of the speed PI controller parameters (gains) using particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique and compares it with the conventional Ziegler-Nichols (ZN) method. Different objective functions have been proposed which are used to evaluate the optimization algorithm. The optimum solution mainly converges to a minimum error which affects the control parameters such as the maximum overshoot, rise time and settling time of the system. Simulation results are obtained using Matlab/Simulink program for photovoltaic pump application during load variation (pump head and flow rate variation). The results show the advantage of the PSO-based optimization approach.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c3444a8804708001af60128/,684,https://engrxiv.org/hbj6d/,10.31224/osf.io/hbj6d,,2019-01-08T06:43:59.601092,2019-01-08T13:34:48.990092

Diamond grinding tools with complex geometry are manufactured with picosecond orthogonal and quasi-tangential combined laser ablation. This rapid and flexible approach for small-scale production of master tools for industrial production trumps conventional approaches. Hitherto, the overall process time is faster compared to conventional technologies with the benefit of free standing diamond grains. A laser manufacturing chain achieving an ablation rate of 35mm3/min with a maximal geometric deviation of 3μm  is presented. The meta-stable diamond structure persists and is assessed via Raman spectroscopy.

6nckp,"Temporal case study of household behavioural response to Cape Town's Day Zero using smart meter data","Faced with the threat of  ""Day Zero"", when it was feared that Cape Town's taps could run dry, consumers reduced household water usage from 540 to 280 litres per household per day over the 36 months between January 2015 and January 2018.  This paper describes the events that prompted this reduction.  We look at how changes in water use were affected by official announcements and by public engagement with this news via the social media activity and internet searches.  
We analysed the water usage of a subset of middle to high income households where smart hot and cold water meters were installed. For hot water usage patterns we compared meter readings with that in another area unaffected by the drought. We further map our  cold water smart meter readings against that of the City of Cape Town's municipal data for  domestic freestanding households --- a sample of more than 400,000 households. We found that the introduction of Level 5 restrictions had a perverse effect on consumption, possibly due to confusing messages. The most dramatic change in behaviour appears to have been instigated by a media storm and consequent user panic after the release of the City's Critical Water Shortages Disaster Plan in October 2017. However, contradictory communication from national and provincial government eroded some of this gain. The paper concludes with recommendations for demand management in a similar future scenario.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c311bb4e8da0e0017519400/,912,https://engrxiv.org/6nckp/,10.31224/osf.io/6nckp,10.1016/j.watres.2018.11.035,2019-01-05T21:09:00.090482,2019-05-26T09:31:55.560634
23fzc,"A potential source of undiagnosed Legionellosis: Legionella growth in domestic water heating systems in South Africa","Legionella is a genus of pathogenic bacterial mesophiles that cause a range of diseases collectively referred to as Legionellosis, with immuno-compromised individuals being particularly susceptible. 
Water heaters, a potential domestic niche for these pathogens, are heavy energy consumers, causing cost-sensitive users to employ energy-saving initiatives, such as scheduling and lower temperature set points. However, lower water temperatures allow Legionella to flourish. This paper uses computational fluid dynamics modelling to show that a horizontal electric water heater provides an environment that is conducive to Legionella growth, although its prevalence is probably higher in the downstream pipes. The presence of Legionella in water heaters is established through water sampled from five in-field water heaters, of which the temperatures and heating schedules are known. Microbiological techniques (PCR and weight-based qRT-PCR) are used to assess the presence of Legionella and Legionella pneumophila at point-of-use taps. A model is used to determine the potential infection rate from these concentrations, demonstrating that undiagnosed Legionellosis infection is likely. 
In low- and middle-income countries, like South Africa, misdiagnosis of Legionellosis may be common due to the shadow cast by HIV and TB prevalence.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c31165c8047080018f511b7/,649,https://engrxiv.org/23fzc/,10.31224/osf.io/23fzc,10.1016/j.esd.2018.12.001,2019-01-05T20:53:18.187750,2019-01-05T21:03:42.334658

We propose a new  method for estimating crowd density by anonymous, non-participatory, indoor Wi-Fi localization of smart phones. Using a probabilistic model inspired by statistical mechanics, and relying only on big data analytics,  we tackle three challenges: (1) the ambiguity of Wi-Fi based indoor positioning, which appears regardless of whether the latter is performed with machine learning or with optimization, (2) the MAC address randomization when a device is not connected, and (3) the volatility of  packet interarrival times.

ndm7f,"Beyond signal quality: The value of unmaintained pH, dissolved oxygen, and oxidation-reduction potential sensors for remote performance monitoring of on-site sequencing batch reactors","Sensor maintenance is time-consuming and is a bottleneck for monitoring on-site wastewater treatment systems. Hence, we compare maintained and unmaintained pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) sensors to monitor the biological performance of a small-scale sequencing batch reactor (SBR). We created soft sensors using engineered features: ammonium valley for pH, oxidation ramp for DO, and nitrite ramp for the ORP. We found that the pH soft sensors are able to reliably identify the completion of ammonium oxidation in the SBR’s effluent even without sensor maintenance for over a year. In contrast, the DO soft sensor using data from a maintained sensor showed slightly better detection performance than that using data from unmaintained sensors, as the DO soft sensor using maintained data is much less sensitive to the optimisation of cut-off frequency and slope tolerance than the soft sensor using unmaintained data. The nitrite ramp provided no useful information on the state of nitrite oxidation, so no comparison of maintained and unmaintained ORP sensors was possible in this case. We identified two hurdles when designing soft sensors for unmaintained sensors: i) Sensors’ type- and design-specific deterioration affects performance. ii) Feature engineering for soft sensors is sensor type specific, and the outcome is strongly influenced by operational parameters such as the aeration rate. In summary, we provide soft sensors that allow the performance of unstaffed small-scale SBRs to be monitored with unmaintained sensors and therefore the maintenance and reliability of OST systems to be optimised.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c29619c0e8efd0017ced460/,952,https://engrxiv.org/ndm7f/,10.31224/osf.io/ndm7f,10.1016/j.watres.2019.06.007,2018-12-31T00:33:09.264681,2020-06-29T17:44:23.810190

The ubiquity of smartphones with embedded position (GPS) and motion (accelerometer) sensors motivates their possible use in these tasks. In this paper, we investigate the use of two real-time digital filters to achieve highly accurate yet reasonably priced measurements of boat speed and distance traveled. Both filters combine acceleration and location data to estimate boat distance and speed; the first using a complementary frequency response-based filter technique, the second with a Kalman filter formalism that includes adaptive, real-time estimates of effective accelerometer bias. The estimates of distance and speed from both filters were
validated and compared with accurate reference data from a differential GPS system with better than 1 cm precision and a 5 Hz update rate, in experiments using two subjects (an experienced club-level rower and an elite rower) in two different boats on a 300 m course. Compared with single channel (smartphone GPS only) measures of distance and speed, the complementary filter improved the accuracy and precision of boat speed, boat distance traveled, and distance per stroke by 44%, 42%, and 73%, respectively, while the Kalman filter improved the accuracy and precision of boat speed, boat distance traveled, and distance per stroke by 48%, 22%, and 82%, respectively.

mv6tz,"Characterizing Long-term Wear and Tear of Ion-Selective pH Sensors","The development and validation of methods for fault detection and identification in wastewater treatment research today relies on two important assumptions: {\em (i)} that sensor faults appear at distinct times in different sensors and {\em (ii)} that any given sensor will function near-perfectly for a significant amount of time following installation. In this work, we show that such assumptions are unrealistic, at least for sensors built around an ion-selective measurement principle. Indeed, long-term exposure of sensors to treated wastewater shows that sensors exhibit important fault symptoms that appear simultaneously and with similar intensity. Consequently, our work suggests that focus of research on methods for fault detection and identification should be reoriented towards methods that do not rely on the assumptions mentioned above. This study also provides the very first empirically validated sensor fault model for wastewater treatment simulation and we recommend its use for effective benchmarking of both fault detection and identification methods and advanced control strategies.

752jh,"Design and Modeling of Novel Low-Pressure Nanofiltration Hollow Fiber Modules for Water Softening and Desalination Pretreatment","Given its high surface area to volume ratio and desirable mass transfer characteristics, the hollow fiber
module configuration has been central to the development of RO and UF technologies over the past five
decades. Recent studies have demonstrated the development of a novel class of low-pressure nanofiltration
(NF) hollow fiber membranes with great promise for scale-up implementation. Further progress on large-scale
deployment, however, has been restrained by the lack of an accurate predictive model, to guide module design
and operation. Earlier models targeting hollow fiber modules are only suitable for RO or UF. In this work,
we propose a new modeling approach suitable for NF based on the implementation of mass and momentum
balances, coupled with a validated membrane transport model based on the extended Nernst-Planck equation
to predict module performance at the system-level. Modeling results are validated with respect to synthetic
seawater experiments reported in an earlier work. A preliminary module design is proposed, and parametric
studies are employed to investigate the effect of varying key system parameters and elucidate the tradeoffs
available during design. The model has significant implications for low-pressure nanofiltration, as well as
hollow fiber NF module design and operation.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c0c40e66be62d001b446181/,973,https://engrxiv.org/752jh/,10.31224/osf.io/752jh,10.1016/j.desal.2018.04.002,2018-12-08T22:13:36.215143,2018-12-08T22:44:09.548874
pnkru,"Relating Transport Modeling to Nanofiltration Membrane Fabrication: Navigating the Permeability-Selectivity Trade-off in Desalination Pretreatment","Faced with a pressing need for membranes with a higher permeability and selectivity, the field of membrane
technology can benefit from a systematic framework for designing membranes with the necessary
physical characteristics. In this work, we present an approach through which transport modeling is employed
in fabricating specialized nanofiltration membranes, that experimentally demonstrate enhanced selectivity.
Specifically, the Donnan-Steric Pore Model with dielectric exclusion (DSPM-DE) is used to probe
for membrane properties desirable in desalination pretreatment. Nanofiltration membranes are systematically
fabricated in-house using layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition to validate model predictions and to develop a
new specialized membrane for this application. The new membrane presents a 30% increase in permeability
and a 50% reduction in permeate hardness relative to state-of-the-art NF membranes. Our results indicate
that a ‘specialized’ tight membrane can outperform looser counterparts in both permeability and selectivity.
Given the possibility of extending this framework to other applications, the work furthers our understanding
of the relationships governing membrane form and function, while having broad potential implications for
future nanofiltration membranes used in chemical separation and purification.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c0c3c909cdb9f001665847f/,584,https://engrxiv.org/pnkru/,10.31224/osf.io/pnkru,10.1016/j.memsci.2018.02.053,2018-12-08T21:57:49.831528,2018-12-08T22:56:37.833660

In this review article, we address its application to various physical phenomena, including elasticity, thermal and electrical conduction, electric and magnetic polarization, as well as multi-physics phenomena governed by coupled equations such as piezoelectricity and thermoelectricity. Especially, we introduce several research works published recently from our research group that consider the anisotropy of the matrix and interfacial imperfections in obtaining various effective physical properties. We begin with a brief review of the concept of the Eshelby tensor with regard to the elasticity and mean-field homogenization of the effective stiffness tensor of a composite with a perfect interface between the matrix and inclusions. We then discuss the extension of the theory in two aspects. First, we discuss the mathematical analogy among steady-state equations describing the aforementioned physical phenomena and explain how the Eshelby tensor can be used to obtain various effective properties. Afterwards, we describe how the anisotropy of the matrix and interfacial imperfections, which exist in actual composites, can be accounted for.

6yz37,"Characterizing Engineering Work in a Changing World: Synthesis of a Typology for Engineering Graduates' Occupational Outcomes","The 21st century has brought an expansion in the variety of occupational roles associated with product, service, and technological development. As a result, it has become more challenging to assess the occupational choices of engineering graduates over time. This paper introduces an engineering graduates’ occupational outcomes typology designed to facilitate consistency among researchers who employ occupational outcome as a dependent variable in original research, such as in studies of underrepresented groups’ persistence in engineering.  The typology is synthesized from the results of a systematic literature review aimed at establishing which work attribute(s) have most consistently united those practicing engineering. The review identifies “design responsibility” – responsibility for the outcomes of design implementation, inclusive of safety, ethicality, and general effectiveness of designs – as an enduring commonality among engineers.  Subsequent stages of the review then uncover how this design responsibility has often manifested in engineering practice. Based on the literature review, we present a series of propositions that underpin general definitions of three types of occupational outcomes – engineering work, engineering-related work, and other work – showing how the types can be distinguished based on the nature of design responsibility associated with each. These definitions thus serve as the foundation for a stratified typology of occupations’ engineering-relatedness. We conclude by discussing how utilization of this stratified approach for measuring engineering graduates’ occupational outcomes can enhance transparency and consistency among studies that examine such outcomes. By building the typology upon a distilled notion of fundamental job responsibility, rather than upon job titles, it is our hope that the typology can serve in a meaningful, enduring occupational benchmarking capacity as new job titles, role formulations, or entire technology areas, come and go.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c095b13ecd5e1001a013150/,621,https://engrxiv.org/6yz37/,10.31224/osf.io/6yz37,,2018-12-06T17:26:35.366641,2018-12-06T18:46:25.160850

issues in wireless networks, such as fading or delay due to slow stations. However, due to
cooperation when data is relayed via other nodes, there network is more prone to attacks.
Since, channel access is very important for cooperation, most of the attacks happens at MAC.
One of the most critical attack is denial of service, which is reason of cooperation failure.
Therefore, the cooperative network as well as simple wireless LAN must be defensive against
DOS attacks.
In this article we analyzed all possible of DoS attacks that can happen at MAC layer of

m5x6t,"Influence of blends of diesel and renewable fuels on CI engine emissions over transient engine conditions.","To reduce the amount of carbon dioxide released from transportation the EU has implemented legislation to mandate the renewable content of petrol and diesel fuels. However, due to the complexity of the combustion process the addition of renewable content, such as biodiesel and ethanol, can have a detrimental effect on other engine emissions. In particular the engine load can have a significant impact on the emissions. Most research that have studied this issue are based on steady state tests, that are unrealistic of real world driving and will not capture the difference between full and part loads. This study aims to address this by investigating the effect of renewable fuel blends of diesel, biodiesel and ethanol on the emissions of a compression ignition engine tested over the World Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP). Diesel, biodiesel and ethanol were blended to form binary and ternary blends, the ratios were determined by Design of Experiments (DoE). The total amount of emissions for CO, CO2 and NOx as well as the fuel consumption, were measured from a 2.4 liter compression ignition (CI) engine running over the WLTP drive cycle. The results depicted that percentages smaller than 10 % of ethanol in the fuel blend can reduce CO emissions, CO2 emissions as well as NOx emissions, but increases fuel consumption with increasing percentage of ethanol in the fuel blend. Blends with biodiesel resulted in minor increases in CO emissions due to the engine being operated in the low and medium load regions over the WLTP. CO2 emissions as well as NOx emissions increased as a result of the high oxygen content in biodiesel which promoted better combustion. Fuel consumption increased for blends with biodiesel as a result from biodiesel's lower heating value. All the statistical models describing the engine responses were significant and this demonstrated that a mixture DoE is suitable to quantify the effect of fuel blends on an engine's emissions response. An optimised ternary blend of B2E9 was found to be suitable as a 'drop in' fuel that will reduce harmful emissions of CO emissions by approximately 34 %, NOx emissions by 10 % and CO2 emissions by 21 % for transient engine operating scenarios such as the WLTP drive cycle.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c07ae69918cc70017c7d468/,600,https://engrxiv.org/m5x6t/,10.31224/osf.io/m5x6t,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113890,2018-12-05T11:28:30.109333,2019-09-19T21:14:52.520520

When someone wants to be registered in an institution such as Birth Certificate, School, College, residence, Tax, BPJS, Bank, Driver Lisence, Passport and others, they must register and register one by one and have a registration number or account for each agency. It can be said that nowadays everyone is bothered with the registration process, starting from the time of birth they must register to be registered as residents, to enter the school must also register, this is felt to be ineffective and inefficient because one must continue to register one by one and redundancy have a registration number that is different for each agency. 
The presence of an electronic resident card (e-KTP) aims to make data collection easier and there is no double KTP number, but this is not yet maximal, there are still multiple KTP numbers, proven by many multiple data communities. Seeing these problems need to find a solution or an effort to ensure that the affairs of registration are not repeated and once up and the number is valid for all agencies. The presence of the latest technology namely IP v6 (Internet Protocol) brings the opportunity for the efficiency and effectiveness of the registration system, because IP v6 is able to provide numbers up to trillions addressing numbers. The objectives of this study are: 1) Designing an analytical model to build an IP V6 model on e-KTP registration. 2) Application of one IP v6 model on e-KTP registration using IPv6 IP address, once the child is born automatically has one registration number i.e. IPv6 address number, and the number applies to all agencies. The method used in this study is an exploration and modeling study of system development with NDLC to produce a model for building IP v6 implementation on e-KTP. The results of the study will show that the community has one registration number, namely IP v6, and the number is valid since the child is born and for all agencies such as birth certificates, e-KTP, Student Number, Passport, Driver’s License, Bank and others The results of the study that implemented IPv6 on numbering e-KTP with a total length of 128 bits, greatly facilitated citizens in terms of registration services because each resident only has one identification number will apply to all agencies, because there is no data repetition or data redundancy, one e-ID card can be applied to elementary schools, high schools, hospitals, BPJS, Driver’s License, passports and for communication addressing or IP addresses to be part of the e-KTP.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c02461eb7ef1400164b8d22/,499,https://engrxiv.org/wdt3g/,10.31224/osf.io/wdt3g,,2018-12-01T08:36:27.066011,2018-12-02T22:03:14.166310

dgj97,"Spray characteristics of a fuel–water internally rapid mixing injector for burner combustion","The fuel-water internally rapid mixing type of injector has been developed to reduce NOx and soot emissions from combustion furnaces operating under high-load conditions. The injector allows spray injection of water emulsified fuel originating from base fuel and water without any surfactants. The aim of present study is to elucidate the mechanism of emulsification occurring in the injector and the atomization characteristics of the injector. We measured the sizes of fuel droplets discharged from the injector by means of a high-speed shadowgraph method combined with image processing. Soybean oil was used as the base fuel. The flow patterns of the fuel and water in a transparent mixing chamber of the injector were also visualized. In addition, we investigated the inner structure of the large droplets sampled by an immersion droplet sampling method. The base fuel, water and air are separately introduced into the injector. In the mixing chamber of the injector, fuel and water are blown by swirling air, and then impinge on the inner wall of the chamber. The base fuel is emulsified through the mixing of fuel with water resulting from the impingement. The emulsified fuel moves to injection holes along the inner wall, and is finally discharged through the injection holes with atomizing air. The probability profiles of droplet size exhibit that the existence probabilities of coarse droplets with diameters greater than approximately 35 mm are increased when the fuel is emulsified. Although the emulsification deteriorates the atomization capability of the injector, the secondary atomization including the micro-explosion occurring in combustion furnaces would form fine droplets, and thus reducing the soot emission from the furnaces. The microscope observations revealed that the emulsified fuel filling in a large droplet sampled corresponds to W/O type.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c00c81e022ce90017141ff7/,467,https://engrxiv.org/dgj97/,10.31224/osf.io/dgj97,,2018-11-30T05:38:20.538580,2020-06-17T12:57:21.501195

Employing this injector allows the injection of a fresh emulsified fuel mixture without requiring surfactants or additional processing equipment. The aim of the present study was to investigate the emulsification, atomization, and emission performance of the injector when using soybean oil as a model high-viscosity fuel from a renewable source. Successful emulsification was observed in the mixing chamber over a wide range of water content ratios up to 0.5, under which a water-in-oil emulsion was discharged from the injector. As the water content ratio was increased, the Sauter mean diameter of the droplets in the spray increased. This is a result of the decrease in the mass flow ratio of atomizing gas to liquid and the increase in the viscosity of the fuel emulsion. Although the emulsification of the base fuel resulted in the discharge of large droplets, the results showed that the nitrogen oxide and particulate matter emissions from a combustion furnace incorporating the injector were found to be reduced simultaneously following the introduction of water even under a high combustion load.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c0093a8b7ef140019492e82/,468,https://engrxiv.org/bqg48/,10.31224/osf.io/bqg48,10.1016/j.energy.2018.10.182,2018-11-30T01:46:40.718645,2020-06-17T12:57:25.788582

FVPM is a conservative, consistent, meshless particle method that incorporates properties of both smoothed particle hydrodynamics and the mesh-based finite volume method. Surface tension force is applied only on free-surface particles, which are inexpensively and robustly detected using the FVPM definition of interparticle area, analogous to cell face area in the finite volume method. We present a model in which the direction of the pairwise surface tension force is approximated by the common tangent of free-surface particle supports.

2pzrv,"Comparison of Replica Leaf Surface Materials for Phyllosphere Microbiology","Artificial surfaces are routinely used instead of leaves to enable a reductionist approach in phyllosphere microbiology, the study of microorganisms residing on plant leaf surfaces. For instance, flat surfaces such as nutrient agar, enable the influence of nutrient supply on microorganisms to be investigated. In contrast microstructured surfaces, such as isolated leaf cuticles or reconstituted leaf waxes enable the influence of physicochemical properties to be investigated. However, interest in replica leaf surfaces as an artificial surface is growing. As replica surfaces offer an improved representation of the complex topography of leaf surfaces. The use of replica leaf surfaces has to date primarily been focused on replicating the superhydrophobic surfaces of leaves. Whereas in this paper, we investigate potential replica surface materials for phyllosphere microbiology studies. Using a test pattern, we investigated the resolution, the degradation characteristics in environmental conditions, surface energy, and bacterial survival characteristics for each potential replica material. Our results indicate that PDMS is the most suitable material for producing replica leaf surfaces. Due to the high resolution achieved through replica molding, extended stability, hydrophobic properties, and bacterial survival characteristics comparable to isolated leaf cuticles. Our experiments highlight the importance of considering the inherent material properties, when selecting a replica leaf surface for phyllosphere microbiology studies. A replica leaf produced in PDMS offers a control surface that can be used for investigating microbe-microbe and microbe-plant interactions in the phyllosphere.

In this study, the surface roughness of spark plug electrodes is investigated as a potential avenue to extend the lean flammability limit of natural gas. A nano-/micro-morphology modification is applied on surface of the spark plug electrode to increase its surface roughness. High-speed Z-type Schlieren visualization is used to investigate the effect of the electrode surface roughness on the spark ignition process in a premixed methane-air charge at different lean equivalence ratios.

da7gf,"A Computational Investigation of Non-Premixed Combustion of Natural Gas Injected into Mixture of Argon and Oxygen","Natural gas is traditionally considered as a promising fuel in comparison to gasoline due to the potential of lower emissions and significant domestic reserves. These emissions can be further diminished by using noble gases, such as argon, instead of nitrogen as the working fluid in internal combustion engines. Furthermore, the use of argon as the working fluid can increase the thermodynamic efficiency due to its higher specific heat ratio. In comparison to pre-mixed operation, the direct injection of natural gas enables the engine to reach higher compression ratios while avoiding knock. Using argon as the working fluid increases the in-cylinder temperature at top dead center and enables the compression ignition of natural gas. In this numerical study, the combustion quality and ignition behavior of methane injected into a mixture of oxygen and argon has been investigated using a three-dimensional transient model of a constant volume combustion chamber. A dynamic structure large eddy simulation model has been utilized to capture the behavior of the non-premixed turbulent gaseous jet. A reduced mechanism consists of 22-species and 104-reactions were coupled with the CFD solver. The simulation results show that the methane jet ignites at engine-relevant conditions when nitrogen is replaced by argon as the working fluid. Ignition delay times are compared across a variety of operating conditions to show how mixing affects jet development and flame characteristics.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bede6ec4b37e100194ca0de/,659,https://engrxiv.org/da7gf/,10.31224/osf.io/da7gf,10.1115/ICEF2018-9618,2018-11-15T21:39:30.668652,2018-11-16T14:17:49.361869

Numerical line mooring models account for this interaction using various seabed models and it is known that the action of liftoff and grounding may lead to large dynamic tension fluctuations. These fluctuations may be spurious due to the inability of discretised mooring models to adequately account for the effect of the seabed on the mooring line. In this work, the root cause and conditions that lead to the production of the large dynamic tension fluctuations is determined. The effect of line discretisation and seabed model on the tension
fluctuations is investigated using the widely used spring-mattress approach and a modified seabed reaction force model. An in-house mooring code was developed to perform these investigations.

These metamaterials require patterning of both a deformable mechanical substrate and an optically-active structure with ~200 nm resolution and precision. The soft nature of the deformable mechanical materials often precludes the use of resist-based techniques for patterning.  Furthermore,    FIB deposition approaches produce metallic structures with considerable disorder and impurities, impairing their optical response.

ntfdp,"Using Drive-by Health Monitoring to Detect Bridge Damage Considering Environmental and Operational Effects","Drive-by Health Monitoring utilizes accelerometers mounted on vehicles to gather dynamic response data that can be used to continuously evaluate the health of bridges faster and with less equipment than traditional structural health monitoring practices. Because vehicles and bridges create a coupled system, vehicle acceleration data contains information about bridge frequencies that can be used as health indicators. However, for drive-by health monitoring to be viable, variabilities in dynamic measurements caused by environmental and operational parameters, such as temperature, vehicle speed, traffic, and surface roughness need to be considered. In this paper, a finite element model of a simply supported bridge is developed considering the aforementioned variabilities and various levels of structural damage. Vehicle acceleration data obtained from the model is analyzed in the frequency domain and processed using a neural network architecture. This method is used to determine the relationships between noise inducing variables and changes in vehicle dynamic response spectrum; these relationships are leveraged to predict the overall health of the subject bridge. The results from this study indicate that the proposed approach can serve as a viable health monitoring strategy and should be further tested on physical bridge systems.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5be9b78dd354e900177d0802/,517,https://engrxiv.org/ntfdp/,10.31224/osf.io/ntfdp,,2018-11-12T17:30:55.981954,2019-07-19T20:42:31.043644

We assess the frequency, duration, and magnitude of such extreme residual load events with a share of VRE generation of about 50% for the case of Sweden. For our analysis, we use 29 years of river runoff and of wind power and PV generation simulated from physical models. Hourly load is simulated from temperature data with a time series model. The resulting time series are combined with historic capacity and ramping restrictions of hydro and thermal power plants in an optimization model to minimize extreme residual load events. Results indicate that under high VRE shares climatic extreme events affect even highly flexible power systems as the Swedish one. Replacing current nuclear power capacities by wind power results on average in three extreme residual load events per year. These events are partly linked to the observation that wind speeds are likely below seasonal average in very cold weather conditions. Deploying PV generation capacities instead of wind increases the number of extreme residual load events by about 6 %, as most events occur during the winter month when solar generation is close to zero.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5be440610fa9f5001cb46995/,419,https://engrxiv.org/9gf82/,10.31224/osf.io/9gf82,,2018-11-08T14:02:21.846012,2019-04-25T20:56:55.960353

An overlay spectrum sharing is proposed by exploiting NOMA in coordinated direct and relay transmission (CDRT) (termed as CSS-NOMA-CDRT). In CSS-NOMA-CDRT, a primary strong NOMA user is directly served by primary transmitter (PT), whereas a primary NOMA weak user needs the assistance of a relay to communicate with PT. Instead of using a dedicated relay, a secondary transmitter (ST) acts as a relay to forward the primary symbol to NOMA weak user and ST transmits own symbol to its receiver at the same time. The performance of the proposed CSS-NOMA-CDRT is evaluated along with closed-form solutions, in terms of ergodic sum capacity and outage probability.

Analytical relationships are identified, producing efficiency maps as a function of various process parameters. Physic-based models are exploited, reproducing electrical and mechanical energy dissipation occurring in the spindle and chiller units and in the material removal process.

3tsgr,"Technical Note: Nominal Stiffness Evaluation and Regression Analysis of GT-2 Rubber-Fiberglass Timing Belts","GT-style rubber-fiberglass (RF) timing belts are designed to effectively transfer rotational motion from pulleys to linear motion in small machines and mechatronic systems. One of the characteristics of belts under this type of loading condition is that the length between load and pulleys changes during operation, thereby changing their effective stiffness. It has been shown that the effective stiffness of such a belt is a function of a ""nominal stiffness"" and the real-time belt section lengths. However, this nominal stiffness is not necessarily constant; it is common to assume linear proportional stiffness, but this often results in system modeling error. This technical note describes a brief study where the nominal stiffness of two lengths (400 mm and 760 mm ) of GT-2 RF timing belts was tested up to breaking point; regression analysis was performed on the results to best model the observed stiffness. The study was replicated three times, providing a total of six stiffness curves. It was found that cubic regression models (R^2 &gt; 0.999) were the best fit, but that quadratic and linear models still provided acceptable representations of the whole dataset with R^2 values above 0.940.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bcae418a334dd0017f0d155/,730,https://engrxiv.org/3tsgr/,10.31224/osf.io/3tsgr,,2018-10-20T08:29:13.646212,2018-10-21T03:27:28.317734
7vkun,"Numerical Modelling of Structural Behaviour of Continuously Reinforced Concrete Pavement","Continuously reinforced concrete pavement (CRCP) rapidly becomes a common standard in most highway pavement design due to its high performance. Early-age cracks play a crucial role in characterising CRCP's long-term performance, hence crack formations and patterns are of interest in most highway departments. The design parameters of a CRCP are studied in this work as a parametric study on efficient design configuration. Numerical experiments were performed to produce a stress profile induced by crack initiation and long-term traffic load. This work contributes a probabilistic study on crack pattern formation from typical stress profile, including environmental and shrinkage stress, as an insight into predicting the likelihood of crack patterns initiation and propagation along the depth of the concrete slab. Studies also showed transverse steel bar plays a crucial role in determining the location of the crack formation, but a minimal effect in controlling crack width and deflection. A study on the probabilistic model helps pavement design to produce a desirable crack pattern, to perform controlled-cracks that enhance the vertical load transferability of a cracked CRCP.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc7ab6c11fd9d001793d7a8/,4961,https://engrxiv.org/7vkun/,10.31224/osf.io/7vkun,,2018-10-17T21:45:01.342512,2018-10-26T20:03:07.331780

Moreover, they present high operation risks regarding their liquid electrolyte. Solid-state batteries are a promising alternative to overcome these problems. They offer safe operation, and potentially improved energy and power density. The option of operating at higher voltages has led to the possibility of employing high capacity electrodes. In this study, the synthesis of a nanostructured anode through electrospinning was carried out. This electrode is based on polymer nanofibres with intercalated graphite particles. The effect of molecular weight, voltage, temperature and humidity has been studied for the formation of smooth and uniform nanofibres. At the optimized conditions, Polyethylene oxide (PEO)-Polyethylene glycol (PEG) nanofibres with diameters around 600 nm were successfully electrospun. The effect of graphite loading on the electrospinning of this solution was also studied. A 30% graphite particle loading in the final fibres was reached with a reproducible methodology. It was found that the electrospun graphite particles received a polymer coating during electrospinning. EDX analysis confirmed that most of the graphite particles are covered by a polymer layer, confirming this hypothesis. Even if it is unclear how this affects the behaviour of the graphite for energy storage, high graphite content was electrospun together with PEO nanofibres with a new methodology.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc4eadadd43d20019c075a4/,307,https://engrxiv.org/cn4j6/,10.31224/osf.io/cn4j6,,2018-10-15T19:41:44.444581,2018-10-15T19:46:25.764869

Therefore, a novel composite for skin tissue engineering is presented by use of blends of Poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) and Poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) were fabricated via the needleless electrospinning technique. The formed PGS/PVP blends were morphologically, thermochemically and mechanically characterized. The morphology of the developed fibers related to the concentration of PGS, with high concentrations of PGS merging the fibers together plasticizing the scaffold. The tensile modulus appeared to be affected by the concentration of PGS within the blends, with an apparent decrease in the elastic modulus of the electrospun mats and an exponential increase of the elongation at break. Ultraviolet (UV) crosslinking of PGS/PVP significantly decreased and stabilized the wettability of the formed fiber mats, as indicated by contact angle measurements. In vitro examination showed good viability and proliferation of human dermal fibroblasts over the period of a week.

9hqs7,"Exploring the Economic, Environmental, and Travel Implications of Changes in Parking Choices due to Driverless Vehicles: An Agent-Based Simulation Approach","Fully driverless automated vehicles (AVs) could considerably alter the proximity value of parking, due to an AV’s ability to drop passengers off at their destination, search for cheaper parking, and return to pick up their occupants when needed. This study estimates the potential impact of privately-owned driverless vehicles on vehicle miles traveled (VMT), energy use, emissions, parking revenue, and daily parking cost savings in the city of Seattle, Washington from changes in parking decisions using an agent-based simulation model. Each AV is assumed to consider the cost to drive to each parking spot, the associated daily parking cost, and the parking availability at each location, and the AV ranks each choice in terms of economic cost. The simulation results indicate at the low penetration rates (5 to 25 percent AV penetration) AVs in downtown Seattle would travel an additional 3.5- 4.0 miles per day on average, and high penetration rates (50 to 100 percent AV penetration) would travel an additional 5.6-8.4 miles per day on average.  The results also suggest that as AV penetration rates increase, parking lot revenues decrease significantly and could likely decline to the point where operating a lot is unsustainable economically, if no parking demand management policies are implemented. This could lead to changes in land use as the amount of parking needed in urban areas is reduced and cars move away from the downtown area for cheaper parking. This analysis provides an illustration of the first-order effects of AVs on the built environment and could help inform near and long- term policy and infrastructure decisions during the transition to automation.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc416f1512c03001990c995/,815,https://engrxiv.org/9hqs7/,10.31224/osf.io/9hqs7,10.1061/(ASCE)UP.1943-5444.0000488,2018-10-15T04:45:18.625763,2018-10-15T13:49:55.934825

hw3xa,"Virtual Mechanical Testing from Low-Dose CT Scans Predicts Tibial Fracture Time to Union and Outperforms Subjective Outcomes Scoring","Background: Quantitative outcomes assessment remains a persistent challenge in orthopaedic trauma. Although patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) and radiographic assessments such as RUST scores are frequently used, very little evidence has been presented to support their validity for measuring structural bone formation or biomechanical integrity.
Methods: A sequential cohort of tibial shaft fracture patients was prospectively recruited for observation following standard reamed intramedullary nailing in a Level I trauma center. Follow-ups at 6, 12, 18, and 24 weeks included X-rays and completion of PROMs (EQ-5D and pain scores). Low-dose computed-tomography (CT) scans were also completed at 12 weeks. Scans were reconstructed in 3D and subjected to virtual mechanical testing via the finite element method to assess fracture limb torsional rigidity relative to intact bone.
Results: Patients reported progressive longitudinal improvement in mobility, self-care, activity, and health over time, but the PROMs were not correlated with structural bone healing. RUST scoring showed moderate intra-rater agreement (ICC = 0.727), but the scores at 12 weeks were not correlated with time to union (R2 = 0.103, p = 0.193) and were only moderately correlated with callus structural integrity (R2 = 0.346, p = 0.010). In contrast, patient-specific virtual torsional rigidity (VTR) was significantly correlated with time to union (R2 = 0.383, p = 0.005) and clearly differentiated one case of delayed union (VTR = 10%, union at 8 months) from the rest of the normally healing cohort (VTR &gt; 60%, median union time 19 weeks) using CT data alone.
Conclusions: PROMs provide insight into the natural history of the patient experience after tibial fracture, but have limited utility as a measure of structural bone healing. RUST scoring, although repeatable, is not a valid longitudinal predictor of time to union. In contrast, virtual mechanical testing from low-dose CT scans provides a quantitative and objective structural callus assessment that reliably predicts time to union and may enable early diagnosis of compromised healing.

7c8kz,"Virtual Structural Analysis of Tibial Fracture Healing from Low-Dose Clinical CT Scans","Quantitative assessment of bone fracture healing remains a significant challenge in orthopaedic trauma research. Accordingly, we developed a new technique for assessing bone healing using virtual mechano-structural analysis of computed tomography (CT) scans. CT scans from 19 fractured human tibiae at 12 weeks after surgery were segmented and prepared for finite element analysis (FEA). Boundary conditions were applied to the models to simulate a torsion test that is commonly used to access the structural integrity of long bones in animal models of fracture healing. The output of each model was the virtual torsional rigidity (VTR) of the healing zone, normalized to the torsional rigidity of each patient’s virtually reconstructed tibia. This provided a structural measure to track the percentage of healing each patient had undergone. Callus morphometric measurements were also collected from the CT scans. Results showed that at 12 weeks post-op, more than 75% of patients achieved a normalized VTR (torsional rigidity relative to uninjured bone) of 85% or above. The predicted intact torsional rigidities compared well with published cadaveric data. Across all patients, callus volume and density were weakly and non-significantly correlated with normalized VTR and time to clinical union. Conversely, normalized VTR was significantly correlated with time to union (R2 = 0.383, p = 0.005). This suggests that fracture scoring methods based on the visual appearance of callus may not accurately predict mechanical integrity. The image-based structural analysis presented here may be a useful technique for assessment of bone healing in orthopaedic trauma research.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bbcfbb90463cb0018cceac4/,438,https://engrxiv.org/7c8kz/,10.31224/osf.io/7c8kz,,2018-10-09T19:18:52.729555,2018-10-09T20:08:04.440950

The automatic identification of 13 points of interest (2, 6, 2, 3 points on the head, trunk, pelvis, arm respectively) is required to estimate the location and orientation of head, trunk, and arm segments, from videos of the clinical test “Segmental Assessment of Trunk Control” (SATCo) which is a test of seated postural control. Methods: Three expert operators manually annotated 13 point-features in every fourth image of 177 short (5-10 second) videos (25 Hz) showing 12 children with cerebral palsy (ages: 4.52 ±2.4, male: 9), participating in SATCo testing.

Results: The point-features were estimated with error 4.40 ±3.75 pixels (mean-pooling), and 4.49 ±4.45 pixels (max-pooling), at approximately 100 images per second. Trunk segment angles (head, neck, 6 thoraco-lumbar-pelvic segments) were estimated with error 6.4° ±2.8° allowing accurate classification (F1 &gt; 80%) of deviation from a reference posture at thresholds up to 3°, 3°, 2° respectively.

It eventually causes widespread structural damages and a disproportionate collapse.  While high level finite-element models incorporating non-linear dynamic analysis will produce more realistic results in progressive collapse scenarios, they are computationally time consuming.  Therefore, the development of a non-linear time history pull-down model that is validated with experimental results would be beneficial for producing acceptable and efficient design solutions, particularly for practicing structural engineers.

r4nmy,"The Disaster Resilience Value of Rooftop Solar in Residential Communities","Distributed energy resources can enhance community resilience to power outages in the aftermath of natural disasters. We develop a method to quantify the resilience value that rooftop solar can provide to residential neighborhoods. We group homes into geographical clusters and simulate the effect of a disaster that disables the electric grid and damages some of the homes. We then use historical energy consumption and solar irradiance data to estimate the likelihood that each cluster could meet its own energy needs given a defined level and pattern of rooftop solar adoption. As a case study, we apply the method to single family homes in San Carlos, California, subjected to an earthquake based on the 1906 San Francisco event. We characterize the impact on resilience of increasing adoption of rooftop solar and of grouping homes into resilience clusters for energy sharing. Policy intervention can ensure more geographically uniform adoption of solar and therefore more even resilience. We evaluate the effect and cost of such an intervention, finding that a modest subsidy can make a notable difference in evening out resilience across a community.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5baa73319108ce0017f6f14b/,351,https://engrxiv.org/r4nmy/,10.31224/osf.io/r4nmy,,2019-10-21T20:33:28.873953,2020-04-20T16:58:28.388287
xjztd,"Self-Aware Autonomous City: From Sensing to Planning","This article presents a knowledge mining model, where a city can plan its development based on existing knowledge during city expansion, for example, telecommunication resource allocation and crowd forecast in a new region. Unlike most works that focused on Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensing, this study is aimed at urban planning by using harvested data, from the perspective of city architects. For large-scale metropolitan areas, a massive amount of data is generated every day, either from static surveys or dynamic IoT sensing. For urban planners, data collection is not their prior concerns. How to transfer harvested knowledge from exiting parts of the city to suburban/rural/ untapped areas is a new challenge. This is because those areas still lack sufficient statistics, and the density of IoT deployment is low. Therefore, development is risky and uncertain. To exploit new regions requires knowledge inference. Such a transition needs data interpretation from historical city dynamics, involving sensor deployment, human activities, and resource allocation in the vicinity. With the proposed model of this article, a city can estimate the requirement for resources when the peripheral areas on the outskirts of a city develops. The same model can be applied to enterprise sides for resource deployment, and applications are not merely limited to governments.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ba876369108ce0015f6646a/,611,https://engrxiv.org/xjztd/,10.31224/osf.io/xjztd,10.1109/MCOM.2019.1800628,2018-09-24T05:37:30.886326,2019-05-17T10:10:18.770513

Two rounds of user testing were performed to evaluate the potential of this arm to aid people living with disabilities in completing activities of daily living. In the first round of user testing, 14 able-bodied subjects successfully completed the prescribed task (pick-and-place) using multiple control schemes after being given a brief introduction and one minute of practice with each scheme.

zwmqx,"Feasibility study of a hot-air tethered aerostat system","The lifting gas used in Lighter-than-Air systems is usually Helium or Hydrogen. Helium is a rare gas and hence very expensive and Hydrogen, though relatively less expensive and easily available, is highly inflammable. Hot air has been used as an LTA gas since the first flight of a balloon in the 18th century, but its utilization in tethered aerostat systems has been limited. The objective of this project is to examine the feasibility of using hot air as the LTA gas in a practical tethered aerostat system. In this study, the thermal analysis of hot air envelope was conducted to predict heat losses and power requirements. This was followed by an experimental study to validate the theoretical values obtained from the thermal model, in which an electrical heating system was inserted inside a spherical envelope made of rip-stop nylon with a fire-retardant coating. Heat loss predictions were extrapolated for a larger size working prototype and feasibility studies were performed. The experimental heat loss predictions were far higher than those obtained using the thermal model available in literature. The power requirement for the smallest possible spherical working prototype made of Polyurethane coated envelope, with a radius of 2.3 m was estimated to be more than 66 kW. However, for an envelope fabricated with a proprietary material named aerofabrix®, around 33% reduction in the power requirement was estimated. These results show a promise for a hot-air based tethered aerostat system, but with several design and operational challenges, which will be highlighted in the paper.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ba492f85a7172001be423dd/,603,https://engrxiv.org/zwmqx/,10.31224/osf.io/zwmqx,,2018-09-21T06:50:14.835902,2018-09-24T18:01:50.469818

The device has a large range of motion in X, Y and Z (14.0 μm in X,Y and 97.9 μm in Z) and can also rotate about two axes (7.4°), making it a 5 degree of freedom scanner. Vertical actuation can be accomplished with both thermal actuators, which have a larger range of motion, and capacitive actuators, which are faster, responding fully up to 3.2 kHz.

Demonstrating the ability to combine the device with other complicated MEMS systems, it is integrated with an XY scanner designed to serve as a shutter to control the flow of atoms.

e2679,"Effects of Heat Affected Zone Softening Extent on the strength of Advanced High Strength Steels Resistance Spot Weld","Resistance spot welds made from Advanced High Strength Steels (AHSS) exhibit Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) softening due to the tempering of pre-existing martensite phase and the consequent decomposition into a mixture of ferrite and cementite. Despite the high strength level for the base metal, the occurrence of HAZ softening may lead to inferior joint strength during Tension-Shear (TS) and Cross-Tension (CT) testing. In this work, we investigated the effects of the HAZ softening on the global loading response for AHSS steels with three different volume fractions of martensite. Microhardness mapping was used as a measure of martensite tempering and extent of softening. Based on the data, the softening was identified in the sub-critical heat affected zone. Hardness drop with the magnitude of 6%, 18%, and 42% was observed in steels with 16%, 52% and 100% of martensite volume fraction (MVF), respectively. In order to model the welded joint loading response using finite element methods (FEM), there is a need to represent the softening in terms of stress-strain relationships. In this work, local stress-strain curves for different weld zones were obtained by scaling the base metal constitutive properties with local hardness ratio. Finite element (FE) simulations of Tension-Shear tests showed that HAZ softening can affect the Tension-Shear load capacity of specimens more significantly when the base metal tensile strength is above 1000 MPa. The paper will discuss the validity of the above finite element approach for describing experimental results and future directions.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b92a0222c77f700167d36b5/,712,https://engrxiv.org/e2679/,10.31224/osf.io/e2679,,2018-09-07T16:05:21.227873,2018-09-07T16:35:42.725909

The emissions reduction achieved by individual aftertreatment components using the same engine and fuel has been assessed and published previously (Liu et al., 2008a, Liu et al., 2008b, Liu et al., 2008c). The present study instead adopted a systems approach to evaluate the net effect of the corresponding technologies for model-year 2004 and 2007 engines. The 2004 engine was equipped with an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system, while the 2007 engine had an EGR system, a crankcase emissions coalescer, and a diesel particulate filter. The test engines were operated under the transient federal test procedure and samples were collected with a source dilution sampling system designed to stimulate atmospheric cooling and dilution conditions. The samples were analyzed for elemental carbon, organic carbon, and C1, C2, and C10 through C33 particle-phase and semi-volatile organic compounds. Of the more than 150 organic species analyzed, the largest portion of the emissions from the 2004 engine consisted of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and naphthalene and its derivatives, which were significantly reduced by the 2007 engine and emissions technology. The systems approach in this study simulates the operation of real-world diesel engines, and may provide insight into the future development of integrated engine technology.

38ub9,"Modeling of the Mechanical Behavior of 3D Bioplotted Scaffolds Considering the Penetration in Interlocked Strands","Three-dimensional (3D) bioplotting has been widely used to print hydrogel scaffolds for tissue engineering applications. One issue involved in 3D bioplotting is to achieve the scaffold structure with the desired mechanical properties. To overcome this issue, various numerical methods have been developed to predict the mechanical properties of scaffolds, but limited by the imperfect representation of one key feature of scaffolds fabricated by 3D bioplotting, i.e., the penetration or fusion of strands in one layer into the previous layer. This paper presents our study on the development of a novel numerical model to predict the elastic modulus (one important index of mechanical properties) of 3D bioplotted scaffolds considering the aforementioned strand penetration. For this, the finite element method was used for the model development, while medium-viscosity alginate was selected for scaffold fabrication by the 3D bioplotting technique. The elastic modulus of the bioplotted scaffolds was characterized using mechanical testing and results were compared with those predicted from the developed model, demonstrating a strong congruity between them. Once validated, the developed model was also used to investigate the effect of other geometrical features on the mechanical behavior of bioplotted scaffolds. Our results show that the penetration, pore size, and number of printed layers have significant effects on the elastic modulus of bioplotted scaffolds; and also suggest that the developed model can be used as a powerful tool to modulate the mechanical behavior of bioplotted scaffolds.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b7c3c772da7bb001b7112f0/,409,https://engrxiv.org/38ub9/,10.31224/osf.io/38ub9,10.3390/app8091422,2018-08-21T16:32:19.506126,2020-03-08T15:05:14.376205
z892e,"Design of Soft Continuum Manipulators Using Parallel Asymmetric Combination of Fiber Reinforced Elastomers","Soft continuum manipulators have large workspace, dexterity and adaptability, but at the cost of complex design construction highlighted by concatenating several individually controlled serial segments. In this paper, we propose a new design
architecture for a soft continuum manipulator composed of a parallel combination of pneumatic actuators. The BR2 manipulator, featured in this paper is asymmetric as it combines one soft bending (B) actuator and two soft rotating (R2) actuators, as opposed to state of the art symmetric architectures that adopt bending segments. Spatial deformation modes are achieved by combining curvature and torsion of the individual actuators. This paper formulates a forward analysis method based on Cosserat rod mechanics to predict the spatial deformation of the manipulator under the effect of external loads with an accuracy less than 9 % of the manipulator length. The model takes into account ‘the coupling effect’ inherent to the asymmetric combination, where pressurizing the rotating actuator attenuates the bending
curvature and vice versa. Consequently, the paper studies the optimal design of the manipulator constituents that minimize the coupling, and thus maximize the workspace and dexterity. A detailed performance study of the BR2 manipulator on a
swiveling base demonstrates a spatial workspace quantified by an axisymmetric area, and sufficient dexterity such that at least 87% of the workspace can be approached with two or more orientations. These are validated through obstacle avoidance, and a pick and place task. The manipulator is also capable of
whole arm manipulation by spiraling along cylindrical objects of varying diameters. These performance attributes surpass any other single segment module and is a potential building block for constructing customized continuum manipulators.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b7afcdcd4676c0017ab749d/,570,https://engrxiv.org/z892e/,10.31224/osf.io/z892e,,2018-08-20T17:46:34.603428,2018-08-20T19:47:33.379897

These types of robots have a continuous backbone that allows them to have infinite degrees of freedom, making them highly compliant, however this brings challenges in terms of modelling and control.  Additionally, materials for this type of application require specific qualities. In this work, we attempt to address these problems while designing a continuum arm suitable for assistive technology applications. Bendy ARM 2.0 is a revised version of the first Bendy ARM robot to accomplish these goals. In its first iteration, Bendy ARM had limitations in its mechanical function, such as the structural performance of the backbone, which decreased the accuracy in positional control. Nitinol was tested as a new backbone material but failed during testing so a low density polyethylene was chosen. Cable conduits were added to help reduce the mechanical coupling between the proximal and distal segments of the manipulator. Motion processing units (MPU) are utilized to gather tilt angles and provide direction for automated movements. Due to the arms natural rotation, this data alone was not enough to consistently control and place the robot.

5dn49,"ELECTROPOLISHING OF ADDITIVELY MANUFACTURED HIGH CARBON GRADE 316 STAINLESS STEEL","Improving surface finishing is the critical step in the application of an additively manufactured (AM) component. This paper provides insights into the electropolishing route for the surface improvement of the AM component made up of 316 stainless steel with &gt;6% carbon. We have discussed the Taguchi design of experiment-based process optimization to understand the role of various process parameters. Profilometry and scanning electron microscopy were performed to study the electropolished and unpolished areas of the AM components. Optical profilometry provided an estimate of the amount of material to be removed to achieve shining and smooth AM surface. Optical profilometry also provided analysis of several roughness parameters on the electropolished surface. Electropolishing was effective in reducing the surface roughness below ~0.1 µm RMS. This sub µm RMS roughness makes an AM component suitable for major engineering applications. SEM showed distinctively different microstructure on the electropolished surface. We also conducted water contact angle study and spectroscopic reflectance study on electropolished and unpolished AM component surface. Our study revealed that electropolishing is a highly promising route for improving the surface finishing of AM components.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b73a0ff78b9a000165ce4dd/,475,https://engrxiv.org/5dn49/,10.31224/osf.io/5dn49,,2018-08-15T03:48:47.599984,2018-08-15T19:16:47.530000
3me2j,"Reducing the Roughness of Internal Surface of an Additive Manufacturing Produced Steel Component by Chempolishing and Electropolishing","Reducing the surface roughness of an additively manufactured (AM) component is one of the most critical factors in determining the suitability of an AM component. As produced surface roughness of an AM component is very high. This prohibits the direct utilization of AM components for the intended applications. For most of the engineering applications, surface roughness must be reduced significantly. Reducing surface roughness is exponentially more challenging for the internal surfaces of a component. This paper reports research in the area of post processing interior surfaces of an AM component. Electropolishing and chemical polishing (chempolishing) methods were applied to reduce the surface roughness of the internal surface.  It was found that chempolishing was very effective in simultaneously reducing the internal and external surface roughness of steel AM components for any complicated AM shape and geometry. The electropolishing methodology employed was very effective in reducing the surface roughness of the internal or external surfaces as long as a counter electrode could be positioned in the proximity of the surface to be polished. However, electropolishing produced better performance on the outer surfaces as compared to chempolishing. This paper summarizes research efforts to tackle the critical issue of reducing the surface roughness of complex AM components.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b70fe5c90a7e0001788412e/,1070,https://engrxiv.org/3me2j/,10.31224/osf.io/3me2j,,2018-08-13T03:55:20.106893,2018-08-13T14:41:10.245107

gxkmw,"Asynchronous Early Output Dual-Bit Full Adder with Reduced Area","This technical note presents the design of a new area optimized asynchronous early output dual-bit full adder (DBFA). An asynchronous ripple carry adder (RCA) is constructed based on the new asynchronous DBFAs and existing asynchronous early output single-bit full adders (SBFAs). The asynchronous DBFAs and SBFAs incorporate redundant logic and are encoded using the delay-insensitive dual-rail code (i.e. homogeneous data encoding) and follow a 4-phase return-to-zero handshaking. Compared to the previous asynchronous RCAs involving DBFAs and SBFAs, which are based on homogeneous or heterogeneous delay-insensitive data encodings and which correspond to different timing models, the early output asynchronous RCA incorporating the proposed DBFAs and/or SBFAs is found to result in reduced area for the dual-operand addition operation and feature significantly less latency than the asynchronous RCAs which consist of only SBFAs. The proposed asynchronous DBFA requires 28.6% less silicon than the previously reported asynchronous DBFA. For a 32-bit asynchronous RCA, utilizing 2 stages of SBFAs in the least significant positions and 15 stages of DBFAs in the more significant positions leads to optimization in the latency. The new early output 32-bit asynchronous RCA containing DBFAs and SBFAs reports the following optimizations in design metrics over its counterparts: i) 18.8% reduction in area than a previously reported 32-bit early output asynchronous RCA which also has 15 stages of DBFAs and 2 stages of SBFAs, ii) 29.4% reduction in latency than a 32-bit early output asynchronous RCA containing only SBFAs.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b5164a9c86a8c000f428101/,312,https://engrxiv.org/gxkmw/,10.31224/osf.io/gxkmw,,2018-07-20T04:29:31.440151,2018-08-08T05:36:02.895954

Recent studies have revealed that neurodegenerative diseases are associated with abnormalities in resting-state functional connectivity. This thesis work aimed to develop a high-throughput preprocessing pipeline for minimizing spatial and temporal artifacts in resting-state fMRI data. The building blocks and cluster computing capabilities of the pipeline are discussed in detail. In an effort to validate this pipeline, a seed-based analysis was performed on preprocessed data using 3 seeds placed in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), supplementary motor area (SMA) and inferior parietal sulcus (IPS). These 3 seeds represent the core components of the default mode network (DMN) and task-positive network (TPN), two of the most commonly examined resting-state networks. Consistent with literature, results indicate that activity in the PCC is functionally correlated to regions of the DMN and anti-correlated to regions of the TPN, whereas activities in the SMA and IPS are functionally correlated to regions of the TPN and anti-correlated to regions of the DMN. These functional connectivity patterns were consistent across scans on both group-level and subject-level. This preprocessing pipeline will support researchers and clinical collaborators of Medical Image Analysis Lab (MIAL) in their analysis of resting-state functional connectivity.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b50bdf41ce7450013dc6f3f/,716,https://engrxiv.org/8d9w5/,10.31224/osf.io/8d9w5,,2018-07-19T16:45:14.724992,2018-07-19T19:13:58.639251

Due to the maturity of offshore wind technology and continued growth of both offshore floating wind and wave energy converter (WEC) technology, there is new opportunity within the offshore renewable energy sector to combine wind and wave technologies in the same leased ocean space through co-located array development. Combining wind and wave energy technologies through co-location is projected to have synergistic effects that reduce direct and indirect costs for developments. While several of these effects have been quantified, many have not been related to cost, and there is currently no cost model that incorporates all of these effects. Further, in areas where fixed-bottom offshore wind structures are infeasible, floating offshore wind platforms could provide access to plentiful resource further offshore.

Localizable sensors also form an inherent part in the functioning of IoT devices and robotics. In this article, the author extends1 a novel scheme for node localization implemented using a hybrid fuzzy logic system to trace the node locations inside the deployment region, presented by the Abhishek Kumar et. al. The results obtained were then optimized using Gauss Newton Optimization to improve the localization accuracy by 50% to 90% vis-à-vis weighted centroid and other fuzzy based localization algorithms.

The study also analyses the effectiveness of such scaling by comparing the localization accuracy. In next section, the article incorporates security in the proposed cooperative localization approach to detect malicious nodes/anchors by mutual authentication using El Gamel digital Signature scheme. A detailed study of the impact of incorporating security and scaling on average processing time and localization coverage has also been performed. The processing time increased by a factor of 2.5s for 500 nodes (can be attributed to more number of iterations and computations and large deployment area with small radio range of nodes) and coverage remained almost equal, albeit slightly low by a factor of 1% to 2%.

This study presents a constructible, financially feasible alternative wind tower design to the 80 m steel tower platform which has the potential to decrease the overall Levelized cost of energy (LCOE). A hexagonal concrete wind tower solution is evaluated to facilitate the fabrication of a taller wind turbine generator to harvest more powerful, stable, and frequent wind resources for elevating wind energy production to cut down the overall LCOE. Subject matter experts from the industry were benefitted from to develop a process and estimate the cost and schedule of development and assembly of this process. To mitigate uncertainties and quantify risks, a sensitivity analysis was carried out on cost and schedule estimates. Also, estimating LCOE of wind towers is a primary requirement for efficient assimilation of wind power generation in the electricity market. In the state of Iowa, wind power is rapidly becoming a significant electricity generator. Unpredictable outputs and different options for deploying wind towers are one of the major problems of power system operators. Good estimation tools are important and will be needed to integrate wind energy into the economic power plant. The other objective of this research is to propose a GIS-based map to visualize LCOE of different wind tower construction options in various locations.

bmu8z,"The effects of turbulent flow on wind turbine performance evaluation","Most of the world's wind turbines operate under various turbulent wind conditions. Turbulent wind is a big source of uncertainty, and could cause, if unaddressed, significant variation from a turbine's calculated efficiency and even its destruction.
Turbulent flow in wind turbines has a profound effect on various aspects including structural load, estimation of a site's energy potential, calculated efficiency, and many more. However, even though significant advances have been made in the field of anemometry the subjects of estimating a wind turbine's site energy potential and analyzing a turbine's efficiency has not been updated.
In this work high frequency wind measurements that included wind speed using two different anemometers, wind direction and others were gathered and analyzed. The energy potential and efficiency of the turbine was calculated using this data and compared to the figures that would have been received by using the methods described in the IEC 61400-12-2 Standard.
Results show that by using a higher frequency measuring system both a site's energy potential and turbine's efficiency can vary substantially in comparison with the methods described in the International Standard.
This research can affect the way a future wind turbine's site energy potential is measured, it can cause existing wind turbine to reevaluate their productivity performance, and on top of all it can cause the examination of the validity of the International Standards regarding wind turbine performance: IEC 61400-12-1 and IEC 61400-12-2.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b2fc122d65eaa000edd8459/,282,https://engrxiv.org/bmu8z/,10.31224/osf.io/bmu8z,,2018-06-24T19:41:47.181580,2018-07-02T11:57:44.058031
fnwjy,"Deep Learning of Vortex Induced Vibrations","Vortex induced vibrations of bluff bodies occur when the vortex shedding frequency is close to the natural frequency of the structure. Of interest is the prediction of the lift and drag forces on the structure given some limited and scattered information on the velocity field. This is an inverse problem that is not straightforward to solve using standard computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods, especially since no information is provided for the pressure. An even greater challenge is to infer the lift and drag forces given some dye or smoke visualizations of the flow field. Here we employ deep neural networks that are extended to encode the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the structure's dynamic motion equation. In the first case, given scattered data in space-time on the the velocity field and the structure's motion, we use four coupled deep neural networks to infer very accurately the structural parameters, the entire time-dependent pressure field (with no prior training data), and reconstruct the velocity vector field and the structure's dynamic motion. In the second case, given scattered data in space-time on a concentration field only, we use five coupled deep neural networks to infer very accurately the vector velocity field and all other quantities of interest as before. This new paradigm of inference in fluid mechanics for coupled multi-physics problems is part of our ongoing development of physics-informed learning machines, where the traditional CFD methodology is abandoned in favor of deep neural networks inference, circumventing the tyranny of elaborate mesh generation.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b2f2690daf8210013d4bceb/,1244,https://engrxiv.org/fnwjy/,10.31224/osf.io/fnwjy,,2018-06-24T05:19:19.619436,2018-07-02T11:57:43.836232
2845a,"Development and validation of a meshless 3D material point method for simulating the micro-milling process","A meshless Generalized Interpolation Material Point Method for simulating the micro-milling process was developed. This method has several advantages over well-established approaches (such as finite elements) when it comes to large plastic strains and deformations, since it inherently does not suffer from tensile
instability problems. The feasibility of the developed material point model for simulating micro-milling is verified against finite element simulations and experimental data. The model is able to successfully predict experimentally measured cutting forces and determine chip temperatures in agreement with conventional finite element simulations. After having verified the approach, the model was applied to perform extensive numerical 3D simulations of the micro-milling process. The goal is to evaluate the response of the micro-milling cutting forces as function of the hardening behavior of the micro-milled material. The meshless 3D simulations reveal a dependency of tool force slopes (with respect to the uncut chip thickness) on the hard-ening parameters. Based on these findings, a new approach is outlined to determine hardening parameters
directly from two micro-milling experiments with distinct, sufficiently large uncut chip thicknesses.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b2bba68d76a3f0010f0800d/,467,https://engrxiv.org/2845a/,10.31224/osf.io/2845a,,2018-06-21T15:09:48.634882,2018-07-02T11:56:47.780071

This approach modifies the traditional written-exam approach typically found in engineering courses, which is inherently inauthentic and cannot easily capture the exploratory nature of engineering design. Our assessment improves alignment with common learning objectives found in first-year engineering design courses and additionally prepares students for the type of case study interviews that are increasingly common for entry-level engineering jobs. To evaluate our assessment, 50 first-year students completed the engineering design self-efficacy instrument once before beginning the assessment and a second time approximately 48 hours later upon completion of a reflection assignment. In addition, students retrospectively reported their perceived change in self-efficacy during the assessment. Analysis shows that students perceived a large retrospective increase in skill level, despite only a small increase in directly measured self-efficacy. These results are analyzed in light of the Dunning-Kruger effect and we posit that the assessment helps to align students’ self-efficacy with their actual skill level. Increased alignment of self-efficacy with skill level may minimize student frustration when encountering challenging tasks in the future, potentially increasing retention of engineering students as well as facilitating the development of lifelong learning attitudes.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b23eb0f8b4bed0010b5625a/,374,https://engrxiv.org/9gkxe/,10.31224/osf.io/9gkxe,,2018-06-15T16:38:12.958917,2018-07-02T11:56:43.086049

Prototypes are unique tools that can enhance communication between these two groups, as prototypes are physical manifestations of the designer’s mental model. Previous work has demonstrated that novice designers often struggle to use prototypes as communication tools. We argue that it is critical that engineering students learn to fully leverage prototypes, and thus the current work sought to understand the relationship between argumentation, prototyping, and design decisions. In order to understand the communication patterns of novice designers during a prototyping task, a controlled study was conducted with a total of 46 undergraduate engineering students.

847je,"A Two-Tiered Grammatical Approach for Agent-based Computational Design","Early stages of the engineering design process are vital to shaping the final design; each subsequent step builds from the initial concept. Innovation-driven engineering problems require designers to focus heavily on early-stage design generation, with constant application and evaluation of design changes. Strategies to reduce the amount of time and effort designers spend in this phase could improve the efficiency of the design process as a whole. This paper seeks to create and demonstrate a two-tiered design grammar that encodes heuristic strategies to aid in the generation of early solution concepts. Specifically, this two-tiered grammar mimics the combination of heuristic-based strategic actions and parametric modifications employed by human designers. Rules in the higher-tier are abstract and potentially applicable to multiple design problems across a number of fields. These abstract rules are translated into a series of lower-tier rule applications in a spatial design grammar, which are inherently domain-specific. This grammar is implemented within the HSAT agent-based algorithm. Agents iteratively select actions from either the higher-tier or lower-tier. This algorithm is applied to the design of wave energy converters, devices which use the motion of ocean waves to generate electrical power. Comparisons are made between designs generated using only lower-tier rules and those generated using only higher-tier rules.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b184c39ec24e20012b3739c/,405,https://engrxiv.org/847je/,10.31224/osf.io/847je,10.1115/DETC2018-85648,2018-06-06T21:05:39.523449,2018-07-02T11:54:48.303501

This paper presents an approach to represent this strategizing behavior using a probabilistic model. This model is employed to select the operations that computational agents should perform while solving configuration design tasks. This work also demonstrates that this probabilistic model can be used to transfer strategies from human data to computational agents ina way that is general and useful. This study shows a successful • transfer of design strategy from human-to-computer agents, opening up the possibility of deriving high-performing behavior from designers and using it to guide computational design agents.

This paper presents a study where engineering teams sought to solve a design task that was subject to two large, unexpected changes in problem formulation that occurred during problem solving. Continuous design data was collected to observe how the designers responded to the changes. We show that high- and low-performing teams demonstrated very different approaches to solving the problem and overcoming the changes. In particular, high-performing teams achieved simple designs and extensively explored small portions of the design space; low-performing teams explored complex designs with little exploration around a target area of the design space. These strategic differences are interpreted with respect to cognitive load theory and goal theory. The results raise questions as to the relationship between characteristics of design problems and solution strategies.

ap3wq,"Improving Irrigation in Remote Areas: Multi-objective Optimization of a Treadle Pump","Water-lifting technologies in rural areas of the developing world have enormous potential to stimulate agricultural and economic growth. The treadle pump, a human-powered low-cost pump designed for irrigation in developing countries, can help farmers maximize financial return on small plots of land by ending their dependency on rain-fed irrigation systems. The treadle pump uses a suction piston to draw groundwater to the surface by way of a foot-powered treadle attached to each suction piston. Current treadle pump designs lift water from depths up to 7 meters at a flow-rate of 1–5 liters per second. This work seeks to optimize the design of the Dekhi style treadle pump, which has gained significant popularity due to its simplicity. A mathematical model of the working fluid and treadle pump structure has been developed in this study. Deterministic optimization methods are then employed to maximize the flow rate of the groundwater pumped, maximize the lift height, and minimize the volume of material used for manufacturing. Design variables for the optimization included the dimensions of the pump, well depth, and speed of various parts of the system. The solutions are subject to constraints on the geometry of the system, the bending stress in the treadles, and ergonomic factors. Findings indicate that significant technical improvements can be made on the standard Dekhi design, such as increasing the size of the pump cylinders and hose, while maintaining a standard total treadle length. These improvements could allow the Dekhi pump to be implemented in new regions and benefit additional rural farmers in the developing world.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b0675d7add54d00144e2bf4/,343,https://engrxiv.org/ap3wq/,10.31224/osf.io/ap3wq,10.1115/DETC2014-35463,2018-05-24T08:25:01.663746,2018-07-02T13:33:10.640014

In civil engineering, this component is typically delivered through multiple projects. These projects may include term projects for individual courses, senior design projects, theses, or independent studies. The focus of these experiences may gradually shift from practice-oriented projects in undergraduate studies to research-oriented projects in graduate studies. Thus, learning objectives should always address both areas with a strong emphasis on common fields, such as applied research. Experiential learning has the capacity to include various program-level outcomes, such as technical knowledge, communication and teamwork. Development of a research and practice group facilitates these outcomes by creating an environment to share the learning experience.

Methods: Four tension band configurations were applied to a metal trochanteric osteotomy model based on a canine femur: figure-of-eight with one twist (OT), figure-of-eight with two twists (TT), dual interlocking single loop (DISL), and double loop (DL). Configurations were mechanically tested under both monotonic loading (n = 8 per configuration) and incremental cyclic loading (n = 8 per configuration). Initial tension after tying, residual tension remaining after each cycle, and failure load at 2 mm of displacement (considered equivalent to clinical failure) were recorded. 

Results: The initial tension and the load to 2 mm of displacement was lower for OT wires compared to TT wires. The DL was the strongest and most stable configuration, generating greater initial tension, maintaining a greater percentage of residual tension under incremental cyclic loads, and resisting higher load before failure at 2 mm. Failure load was highly correlated with initial tension. 

Conclusion: This model enabled evaluation of tension band wire configuration independent of the fixation pin portion of the construct. Wire configurations that can be tightened to a greater tension during tying, like the DL, are better able to resist the tensile loads experienced by the construct. 

Clinical impact: In clinical situations where high tensile loads are expected, a tighter, more secure tension band wire configuration may be warranted.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b032b05a556d000130776bd/,592,https://engrxiv.org/5yfsx/,10.31224/osf.io/5yfsx,,2018-05-21T20:48:08.188078,2019-08-09T17:31:15.738767

cft72,"A stabilising control strategy for Cyber-Physical Power Systems","The cyber-physical nature of electric power systems has increased immensely over the last decades, with advanced communication infrastructure paving the way. It is now possible to design wide-area controllers, relying on remote monitor and control of devices, that can tackle power system stability problems more effectively than local controllers. However, their performance and security relies extensively on the communication infrastructure and can make power systems vulnerable to disturbances emerging on the cyber side of the system. In this paper, we investigate the effect of communication delays on the performance and security of wide-area damping controllers (WADC) designed to stabilise oscillatory modes in a Cyber-Physical Power System (CPPS). We propose a rule-based control strategy that combines wide-area and traditional local stabilising controllers to increase the performance and maintain the security of CPPS. The proposed strategy is validated on a reduced CPPS equivalent model of Great-Britain (GB).",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b01d356e9cb34000fb1eaeb/,577,https://engrxiv.org/cft72/,10.31224/osf.io/cft72,10.1049/iet-cps.2018.5020,2018-05-20T20:13:43.491891,2019-02-18T14:32:11.358021

ch3vm,"Geostatistical modelling of pore pressure data: An application to Smart Markers (ENSM) in Open-Pit Mining","scription
Edit
For the mining industry, it is essential to know the distribution of the pore pressures exerted by the groundwater in the walls of the pit, which depends on the hydrogeological characteristics of the rock and the excavations. An inadequate management of pore pressures in open-pit mining can obstruct access to operating areas, increase the use of explosives and increase their failure, generate acid drainage and geotechnical instability in the pit itself. However, in mining practice pore pressure measurements are scarce. In order to overcome this limitation, intelligent markers (Enhanced Networked Smart Markers-ENSM) have been developed, which have pore pressure and deformation sensors coupled to pit drillings in depths of up to 200m. This network of intelligent sensors (ENSM) could provide a wealth of data never before recorded in open-pit mining operations, which allows knowing more accurately the hydrogeological conditions and anticipate the dynamics of pit deformation. In the present contribution, we propose a strategy to model the spatial continuity of the regionalized data set that will capture the intelligent markers, through a variographic analysis, to then predict the pore pressure in space and represent the variability in all spatial scales. The methodological approach proposed allows understanding how the rocks and the water contained, respond to changes in the tensional state and the hydraulic pressure regime originated by mining operations. Moreover, the proposed approach identifies the spatial variability of pore pressures and the existence of heterogeneities and allow to achieve better coupled geotechnical models. However, in a system strongly controlled by geological structures where the flow of water in the hydrogeological units can be diverted and the measurement depends on the direction of sampling, its implementation is limited and requires extensive theoretical development, considering two dimensions for the cross space i.e., the azimuth and the inclination additionally to the three conventional coordinates (north, east and elevation).",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b0075b4e9cb340010b17a5e/,278,https://engrxiv.org/ch3vm/,10.31224/osf.io/ch3vm,,2018-05-19T19:12:53.767200,2018-07-02T11:53:22.423387

Although many studies have considered the problem of aimpoint selection in order to maximise the expected score a player can achieve, few have considered the more general strategical question of minimising the expected number of turns required for a player to finish. By casting the problem as a Markov decision process and utilising the reinforcement learning method of value iteration, a framework is derived for the identification  of the optimal aimpoint for a player in an arbitrary game scenario. This study represents the first analytical investigation of the full game under the normal game rules, and is, to our knowledge, the first application of reinforcement learning methods to the optimisation of darts strategy.

njdcu,"Stochastic modeling of knee arthrometry for Intact, partial and ruptured ACL","Knee pain and injuries are very common in athletes. Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is one of the most important reason of knee acute and chronic pains. As ACL plays a significant role in knee stability and due to amount of reported ACL related injuries, much effort has been placed on finding proper and on time diagnosis and treatment of these injuries. Arthrometric methods are the most non-invasive reliable diagnosis option; however they are trusted to distinguish partial injuries from intact joint and instead expensive and more time consuming imaging diagnosis techniques (i.e MRI) are used. Arthromery results can be investigated by quantifying the tests using computer simulations; so far few studies have been conducted toward this goal.
In this study a two dimensional finite flement (FE) model of knee joint under standard arthrometry state (by a KT-2000 arthrometer) was built. This model was then used to evaluate the effect of precise modeling of tibiofemoral contact-surface geometry with considering flexible articular cartilage in the joint. The results revealed that exact modeling of the contact geometry highly influences the simulation results. In the next step, the built model was used in a stochastic modeling with the experimental data obtained from literature in order to simulate a real diagnosis circumstance and to provide a statistical comparison between seven different levels of ACL injury. The result of this simulation shows that although arthrometry may be able to distinguish partial injuries from intact in most cases leading to less ACLD with appropriate treatment, but it is hard to tell anything about the level of injury. To prevent the costs of imaging techniques moving towards the introduction of new measuring methods (or newly defined identifiers) or using intelligent processing of currently obtained data is suggested.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5af5fb5d7bf0b90012e3e687/,225,https://engrxiv.org/njdcu/,10.31224/osf.io/njdcu,,2018-05-11T20:29:44.079489,2018-07-02T11:51:28.134724
yz4a7,"An efficient multiscale modeling framework for nonlinear analyses of composite structures","Traditional multiscale modeling methods of composite structures are based on the global-local approach whereby the global analysis of structures are first performed to determine potential damage regions, followed by local analyses at those regions to identify detailed damage patterns and failure modes. Such an approach does not take into account the localized effects of critical regions on the global analysis and may become less accurate in general. To address better the behavior of local regions on multiscale analyses, homogenization-based multiscale methods are applied. For each load increment, the global problem is solved simultaneously with one Representative Volume Element (RVE) equilibrium problem for each Gauss point of the global mesh. This approach is successful to capture the local behavior at each material point; however, it is computationally expensive since the RVE is called at all the Gauss points in the global model for each load increment. 
We develop an efficient multiscale modeling method whereby the RVE analyses are only called at specialized locations by multiscale elements and run parallel with the global analysis. The constitutive models of multiscale elements are defined in a user-defined element subroutine (UEL) where stiffnesses of the multiscale elements are unknown at the beginning of the analysis. They can only be obtained by performing a series of RVE analyses for each set of loads received from the global analysis. The advantage of the proposed method is that the stiffnesses of the multiscale elements are directly computed from the RVE analyses and keep updated for each global load increment. The nested multiscale modeling is implemented by Python script and highly capable for nonlinear analysis of composite structures.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5af59fd0a5bbbc000fc78e60/,381,https://engrxiv.org/yz4a7/,10.31224/osf.io/yz4a7,,2018-05-11T13:52:41.598523,2019-03-10T06:51:28.208396

rvtgs,"Bounding Surface Elasto-Viscoplasticity: A General Constitutive Framework for Rate-Dependent Geomaterials","A general framework is proposed to incorporate rate and time effects into bounding surface (BS) plasticity models. For this purpose, the elasto-viscoplasticity (EVP) overstress theory is combined with bounding surface modeling techniques. The resulting constitutive framework simply requires the definition of an overstress function through which BS models can be augmented without additional constitutive hypotheses. The new formulation differs from existing rate-dependent bounding surface frameworks in that the strain rate is additively decomposed into elastic and viscoplastic parts, much like classical viscoplasticity. Accordingly, the proposed bounding surface elasto-viscoplasticity (BS-EVP) framework is characterized by two attractive features: (1) the rate-independent limit is naturally recovered at low strain rates; (2) the inelastic strain rate depends exclusively on the current state. To illustrate the advantages of the new framework, a particular BS-EVP constitutive law is formulated by enhancing the Modified Cam-clay model through the proposed theory. From a qualitative standpoint, this simple model shows that the new framework is able to replicate a wide range of time/rate effects occurring at stress levels located strictly inside the bounding surface. From a quantitative standpoint, the calibration of the model for over-consolidated Hong Kong marine clays shows that, despite the use of only six constitutive parameters, the resulting model is able to realistically replicate the undrained shear behavior of clay samples with OCR ranging from 1 to 8, and subjected to axial strain rates spanning from 0.15%/hr to 15%/hr. These promising features demonstrate that the proposed BS-EVP framework represents an ideal platform to model geomaterials characterized by complex past stress history and cyclic stress fluctuations applied at rapidly varying rates.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5af4d337d6e6eb001023930f/,518,https://engrxiv.org/rvtgs/,10.31224/osf.io/rvtgs,,2018-05-10T23:30:51.006615,2019-04-10T10:54:43.171158

The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of out-of-plane deformation on surface strain measurements in healthy and damaged ligaments. Tensile tests on five porcine posterior cruciate ligaments (PCL) were performed before and after damage using the femur – PCL – tibia construct. Damage was simulated by loading the ligament to its maximum force capacity.  Digitized surface dots were tracked using an optical motion capture system. The transverse strain (ε_xx), longitudinal strain (ε_yy), and shear strain (γ_xy) distributions on the ligament surface were obtained for the control and damaged states using two-dimensional (2d) strain and three-dimensional (3d) strain measurements. There was no significant difference between the 2d and 3d strains in the control state for all three strains. However, the value and location of the peak strain values (tensile and compressive) in ligament surfaces did change. The 2d peak tensile strain was both over and under-estimated, compared to 3d strain, when out of plane deformation was included for ε_xx and ε_yy; but consistently overestimated for positive γ_xy. The percentage of damaged regions, quantified as a loss in tensile strength, after damage was overpredicted by 2d strain for ε_yy. Care should be taken when using 2d surface strain as peak values and local damage is sensitive to out-of-plane deformation.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ae8a36e91de99000e1ad9e0/,433,https://engrxiv.org/e8j3w/,10.31224/osf.io/e8j3w,,2018-05-01T17:32:35.353176,2018-07-02T11:50:33.429246

First, experiential conjoint analysis was used to obtain individual empirical utility functions for drinking mug designs.

Then, a number of functions for constructing group preference were analysed using both randomly generated preferences and empirical preferences derived from the experiential conjoint survey.

This work applies data-mining techniques to quantitatively study the processes that designers use to solve configuration design problems. The guiding goal is to extract beneficial design process heuristics that are generalizable to the entire class of problems. The extraction of these human problem-solving heuristics is automated through the application of hidden Markov models to the data from two behavioral studies.

zetj9,"Capturing Human Sequence-Learning Abilities in Configuration Design Tasks through Markov Chains","Designers often search for new solutions by iteratively adapting a current design. By engaging in this search, designers not only improve solution quality but also begin to learn what operational patterns might improve the solution in future iterations. Previous work in psychology has demonstrated that humans can fluently and adeptly learn short operational sequences that aid problem-solving. This paper explores how designers learn and employ sequences within the realm of engineering design. Specifically, this work analyzes behavioral patterns in two human studies in which participants solved configuration design problems. Behavioral data from the two studies are first analyzed using Markov chains to determine how much representation complexity is necessary to quantify the sequential patterns that designers employ during solving. It is discovered that first-order Markov chains are capable of accurately representing designers' sequences. Next, the ability to learn first-order sequences is implemented in an agent-based modeling framework to assess the performance implications of sequence-learning abilities.

However, a team having the wrong characteristics may perform more poorly than the sum of its individuals. Therefore, it is vital that teams are assembled and managed properly in order to maximize performance. This work examines how the properties of configuration design problems can be leveraged to select the best values for team characteristics (specifically team size and interaction frequency). A computational model of design teams which has been shown to effectively emulate human team behavior is employed to pinpoint optimized team characteristics for solving a variety of configuration design problems. These configuration design problems are characterized with respect to the local and global structure of the design space, the alignment between objectives, and the resources allotted for solving the problem. Regression analysis is then used to create equations for predicting optimized values for team characteristics based on problem properties. These equations achieve moderate to high accuracy, making it possible to design teams based on those problem properties. Further analysis reveals hypotheses about how the problem properties can influence a team’s search for solutions. This work also conducts a cognitive study on a different problem to test the predictive equations. For a configuration problem of moderate size, the model predicts that zero interaction between team members should lead to the best outcome.

Here we present a structure-based algorithm for separating cortical compartments from trabecular bone in binarized images. Using the thickness of the cortex as a seed value, bone connected to the cortex within a spatially local threshold value is identified and separated from the remaining bone. The algorithm was tested on biological images from human, chim- panzee, and gorilla datasets and compared to manual measurements. The average error was 2-3 voxel differences in thickness and total area errors were less than ten percent. The algorithm is repeatable, efficient, and requires few user inputs, provid- ing a means of separating cortical from trabecular bone.

fsqcz,"ENABLING GRADUATE ENGINEERING STUDENTS WITH PROFICIENCY IN MOBILE ROBOTICS","In recent years, an aggressive expansion of research as well as commercialization efforts in autonomous vehicles can be witnessed. At the same time, many existing companies have expanded their portfolio to autonomous technologies as well (e.g. NVIDIA). This has created an already large need for autonomous-vehicle engineers who are not only proficient in single traditional engineering fields (e.g. mechanical) and old-school automotive studies, but who also have acquired the significantly different, interdisciplinary skillset for mobile robotics. Unlike students of computer science, mechanical engineering graduate students are hardly exposed to coding and robotic system integration in current traditional curricula. The new demands of the automotive industry require an automotive engineer who understands the science of autonomy as well as its impact on the design and implementation of autonomous vehicles, and is equipped with hands-on experience with the latest technology in the field.
We describe a unique education program that draws content from traditional courses on mobile-robotics as well as incorporates experiential learning by hands-on training in software, specifically addressing the skill gap in traditional automotive engineering education. Geared towards engineering students with no previous training in robotic system integration, and with only basic undergraduate understanding of programming languages, the teaching experiment employed an active learning approach to introduce numerous concepts as a host of hands-on exercises on multiple robotic platforms. Beginning with simple tutorials on networked communication to demonstrate the power of ROS, the course built up to complete control system design on a student-built RC car that can avoid obstacles and navigate a racecourse by performing SLAM.
A brief evaluation of the course exhibited good student performance in general with unique and creative approaches to the programming tasks in particular. Although employing different approaches, each student team was able to demonstrate comparable, efficient performance.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ae235cebb99c00010488344/,541,https://engrxiv.org/fsqcz/,10.31224/osf.io/fsqcz,,2018-04-26T20:43:47.444942,2018-07-02T11:50:09.597016

This paper presents a new approach regarding PQ assessment by examining PQ decomposed into a structure with the top-down approach to the level of basic (“ground”) attributes, covering almost every aspect of car quality perception from the engineering viewpoint. The paper proposes a novel method for PQ attributes relative importance ranking, resulting in the PQ balance of the vehicle, within the given conditions. The proposed method helps to reach the equilibrium of the vehicle’s quality equation from the perspective of design effort, time and costs estimations. The authors introduce the Perceived Quality Framework (PQF), which is the taxonomy system for PQ attributes and the core of the attributes importance ranking method. The research outcomes are based on findings of qualitative exploratory study that includes the European and North American premium and luxury automotive manufacturers. To validate the proposed method, an industrial pilot study was performed with one of the automotive companies to examine the PQ attributes importance ranking obtained from automotive industry professionals.

fv47e,"MultiDIC: an Open-Source Toolbox for Multi-View 3D Digital Image Correlation","Three-dimensional Digital Image Correlation (3D-DIC) is a non-contact optical-numerical technique for evaluating the dynamic mechanical behavior at the surface of structures and materials, including biological tissues. 3D-DIC can be used to extract shape and full-?eld displacements and strains with high resolution, at various length scales. While various commercial and academic 3D-DIC software exist, the field lacks 3D-DIC packages which offer straightforward calibration and data-merging solutions for multi-view analysis, which is particularly desirable in biomedical applications. To address these limitations, we present MultiDIC, an open-source MATLAB toolbox, featuring the first 3D-DIC software specifically dedicated to multi-view setups. MultiDIC integrates robust two-dimensional subset-based DIC software with specially tailored calibration procedures, to reconstruct the dynamic behavior of surfaces from multiple stereo-pairs. MultiDIC contains novel algorithms to automatically merge meshes from multiple stereopairs, and to compute and visualize 3D shape and full-?eld motion, deformation, and strain. User interfaces provide capabilities to perform 3D-DIC analyses without interacting with MATLAB syntax, while standalone functions also allow proficient MATLAB users to write custom scripts for specific experimental requirements. This paper discusses the challenges underlying multi-view 3D-DIC, details the proposed solutions, and describes the algorithms implemented in MultiDIC. The performance of MultiDIC is tested using a low-cost experimental system featuring a 360-deg 12-camera setup. The software and system are evaluated using measurement of a cylindrical object with known geometry subjected to rigid body motion and measurement of the lower limb of a human subject. The findings confirm that shape, motion, and full-field deformations and strains can be accurately measured, and demonstrate the feasibility of MultiDIC in multi-view in-vivo biomedical applications.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ada3d38144be4000f7a6211/,3588,https://engrxiv.org/fv47e/,10.31224/osf.io/fv47e,10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2843725,2018-04-20T19:25:14.916811,2019-01-10T23:06:32.279387

It is observed that the referenced article has not provided a general logic synthesis algorithm excepting only an example illustration involving a 3-input AND logic function. The absence of a general logic synthesis algorithm would make it difficult to reproduce the research described in the referenced article. Moreover, the example illustration in the referenced article describes an unsafe quasi-delay-insensitive logic decomposition which is not suitable for the multi-level synthesis of strong-indication asynchronous circuits. Further, a logic synthesis method which safely decomposes the DIMS solution to synthesize multi-level strong-indication asynchronous circuits is available in the existing literature, which was neither cited nor taken up for comparison in the referenced article, which is another drawback. Subsequently, it is concluded that the referenced article has not advanced existing knowledge in the field but on the contrary, has caused confusions. Hence, in the interest of readers, this work additionally highlights some important and relevant literature which provide valuable information about robust asynchronous circuit synthesis techniques which employ delay-insensitive codes for data representation and processing and a 4-phase handshake protocol (return-to-zero) for data communication.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ad9c63b144be400117990ed/,351,https://engrxiv.org/kd695/,10.31224/osf.io/kd695,,2018-04-20T10:59:47.592811,2018-07-02T11:48:45.815486

dq72t,"Evaluation of Self-Consolidating Concrete Robustness by Measuring Electrical Conductivity of Plastic Concrete","This paper is aimed to review robustness of Self-Consolidating Concrete (SCC) in term of resistance against static segregation and bleeding. SCC is a highly fluid and non-segregating concrete able to spread through even dense reinforcement and homogenously fill formwork without using any external mechanical consolidation. Due to field requirements, SCC should be able to sustain its desired fresh properties over a relatively long time (about two or three hours) making it more susceptible to segregation than conventional concrete. Although there are a couple
of proposed test methods to evaluate SCC robustness, multi-electrodes electrical conductivity technique could be a reliable, non-destructive, inexpensive and simple test method to continuously monitor progress of hydration reactions (even indicating initial and final setting time) and stability (bleeding and both static and dynamic aggregate segregation) of plastic cement-based materials over the early-age period. In this paper, a brief review on fresh properties of SCC and static
aggregate segregation has been taken place. Then, different methods for measuring concrete conductivity have been investigated. Afterward, some studies on evaluation of stability of cement-based materials and SCC have been reviewed. Finally, based on the literature, some recommendations for future works are introduced.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ac2e77629ad60000e309571/,666,https://engrxiv.org/dq72t/,10.31224/osf.io/dq72t,,2018-04-03T02:35:55.501267,2018-07-02T11:48:04.983125

Despite the existence of detailed protocols and automation, the real behavior is hard to measure and predict. The human factor is a source of uncertainty, and this fact is of special relevance when facing stressful situations. Informal team working culture, time shifts or external pressure are main sources of change. In this research we use time series analysis as a statistical proxy to detect this kind of drift in teams that solve network failures if three live services: IPTV, Cloud Infrastructure and IoT. This task is
known as incident management. This would provide not only a numerical evidence of the uncertainty in troubleshooting of digital services but also an

qsfp7,"Estimating turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation with internal flow loss coefficients","Estimating the turbulent kinetic energy at the nozzle outlet is necessary to model turbulent jet breakup. We identified errors in a model of nozzle turbulence developed by Huh et al. which made the model inaccurate. To develop an improved model, we derived a generalized form of the Bernoulli equation for non-cavitating flows. The equation can be used to estimate turbulent kinetic energy, k, and dissipation, ε, in internal flows given loss coefficients or friction factors and a turbulence model. The equation allows turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation to be estimated without computational fluid dynamics. The estimates can be used as-is where turbulent kinetic energy or dissipation are desired, or as a more accurate boundary condition for computational fluid dynamics. A model for fully developed pipe flow is developed and compared against experimental data. A nozzle turbulence model which could replace Huh et al.'s is also developed, but the model has not been validated due to a lack of experimental data.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5abdc359266c2a000fc231ef/,1344,https://engrxiv.org/qsfp7/,10.31224/osf.io/qsfp7,,2018-03-30T04:59:47.525103,2020-01-04T20:55:00.151112

The first one aims to preserve the original pairwise comparisons as much as possible and the second one improves the consistency ratio as much as possible. Both algorithms were compared with other 11 methods, from the past and recent literature, through three numerical examples: one inconsistent matrix with 9 criteria, one with 8 criteria and the last one, a highly inconsistent matrix with 7 criteria. Our method performed better than all the other ones. The proposed method can be used independently from the techniques to derive the eigenvector, eigenvalue or the consistent ratio, and naturally, in order to make a sensible comparison, all methods were compared using the same techniques. The Conservative Algorithm solution, gains in quality because it can preserve most of the original information, however the consistent ratio value stays just below the consistency threshold, in the other hand, the Progressive Algorithm gains in quantity, because it aims to reduce the consistent ratio to zero or near zero.

dytsv,"Study of Homogeneous Bubble Nucleation in Liquid Carbon Dioxide by a Hybrid Approach Combining Molecular Dynamics Simulation and Density Gradient Theory","A new method for predicting homogeneous bubble nucleation rates of pure compounds from vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) data is presented. It combines molecular dynamics simulation on the one side with density gradient theory using an equation of state (EOS) on the other. The new method is applied here to predict bubble nucleation rates in metastable liquid carbon dioxide (CO2). The molecular model of CO2 is taken from previous work of our group. PC-SAFT is used as an EOS. The consistency between the molecular model and the EOS is achieved by adjusting the PC-SAFT parameters to VLE data obtained from the molecular model. The influence parameter of density gradient theory is fitted to the surface tension of the molecular model. Massively parallel molecular dynamics simulations are performed close to the spinodal to compute bubble nucleation rates. From these simulations, the kinetic prefactor of the hybrid nucleation theory is estimated, whereas the nucleation barrier is calculated from density gradient theory. This enables the extrapolation of molecular simulation data to the whole metastable range including technically relevant densities. The results are tested against available experimental data and found to be in good agreement. The new method does not suffer from typical deficiencies of classical nucleation theory concerning the thermodynamic barrier at the spinodal and the bubble size dependence of surface tension, which is typically neglected in classical nucleation theory. In addition, the density in the center of critical bubbles and their surface tension is determined as a function of their radius. The usual linear Tolman correction to the capillarity approximation is found to be invalid.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ab8e81a76e58c0010f9e274/,504,https://engrxiv.org/dytsv/,10.31224/osf.io/dytsv,10.1063/1.5022231,2018-03-26T19:06:30.759051,2018-07-02T11:45:30.230988

Material synthesis processes require specific operating conditions in order to carry out the desired chemical reactions and property transformations, including the creation of paper-templated metals and nanoparticles. The 1.13 liter combustion chamber includes a test stand for conducting the material synthesis experiments.

In comparison to furnaces and ovens, this approach provides greater flexibility for materials synthesis procedures.

yxvga,"The Influence of Mixedness on Ignition for Hydrogen Direct Injection in a Constant Volume Combustion Chamber","The ignition behavior of the fuel in non-premixed turbulent combustion applications such as diesel engines and gas turbines is dependent on the mixing rate of the injected fuel and the working fluid. In this study, three-dimensional modeling of hydrogen injection into a constant volume combustion chamber (CVCC) is used to investigate the correlation between the mixing rate and important parameters of non-premixed combustion, such as ignition delay. Mixedness is quantified using mean spatial variation, which reflects the homogeneity of the mixture, and mean scalar dissipation, which represents the local gradients of the scalar. The case studies include nitrogen and argon as working fluids; injection velocities and nozzle diameters are varied for comparison. For consistency, the injected mass is kept constant and the injection duration is adjusted accordingly. The results indicate that a strong correlation exists between ignition delay and the defined mixedness parameters. The cases with higher mixedness values lead to a shorter ignition delay and a higher maximum flame temperature. Changing the working fluid and injection parameters can effectively modify the mixedness, and consequently affect the ignition onset and flame properties.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ab29df8ea370000138cf7b4/,556,https://engrxiv.org/yxvga/,10.31224/osf.io/yxvga,,2018-03-21T18:05:19.460453,2018-07-02T11:45:24.495541
9rgu6,"Linear static isogeometric analysis of an arbitrarily curved spatial Bernoulli-Euler beam","The present research is focused on the linear analysis of a spatial Bernoulli-Euler beam. Metrics of the reference and deformed configurations are rigorously defined with respect to the convective coordinate frame of reference. No higher order terms are neglected which makes the formulation ideally suited for analysis of arbitrarily curved spatial beams in the frame of finite (but small) strain theory. The well-known issue of nonorthogonality of local coordinate system at an arbitrary point of a spatial beam is solved by the introduction of a new coordinate line that is orthogonal to the normal plane of the beam axis at each point. Generalized coordinates of the present model are translations of the beam axis and the angle of twist of a cross section. Two different parameterizations of this angle are discussed and implemented. Both geometry and kinematics are described with the same set of NURBS functions, in line with the isogeometric approach. Numerical analysis proved that the theoretical considerations are correct. An in-depth analysis of convergence properties has confirmed the fact that models with the highest interelement continuity have an improved accuracy per DOF, for problems that result in a smooth structural response.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ab2373afb9476000d2a4d28/,435,https://engrxiv.org/9rgu6/,10.31224/osf.io/9rgu6,,2018-03-21T10:51:23.895307,2018-07-02T11:45:23.624225

Considering recent advances in bearing capacity theory, namely with respect to the interaction diagrams developed for general loading, a theoretical model for computing the horizontal force or torque from fundamental input parameters such as the vertical force (weight), wheel diameter, and undrained shear strength of the soil is presented. The predictions are compared with existing analytical solutions and data from laboratory testing, and reasonable agreement is demonstrated. The foremost conclusion is that bearing capacity theory can be used to obtain reasonable predictions of wheel forces analytically under any operating condition (driven, braked, or towed), provided the contact length and so-called contact angle, which defines the position of the contact interface, can be estimated. Aside from providing a rigorous and highly convenient framework for evaluating wheel forces under arbitrary loading, the analysis enables a natural physical interpretation of the mobility problem.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5aaee11b80f2d3000d5999d4/,428,https://engrxiv.org/8s59e/,10.31224/osf.io/8s59e,10.1504/IJVP.2017.081276,2018-03-18T22:04:52.303674,2018-07-02T11:43:52.580416

Velocity fluctuations at the free surface are hypothesized to be the cause of turbulent jet breakup. We formalize this idea by treating the fluctuations as random variables, subject to damping from the free surface. In contrast to previous theories, we use a conditional ensemble average to determine quantities of interest because not all fluctuations produce droplets. An energy balance and a closure model are used to determine the Sauter mean diameter. Similar approaches are used to determine the breakup onset location, breakup length, and spray angle. A criteria for the transition to the turbulent atomization regime is derived under the hypothesis that the cause is a change in the minimum velocity from the Hinze scale to the Kolmogorov scale.

This results in formation of weak planes along the extrusion process. It has been observed that large longitudinal cracks often form in these shafts before any circumferential cracks when these shafts are subjected to cyclic torsion due to electrical line faults.  The presence of these cracks could severely compromise the shaft resonance frequencies.  Dynamic response of shafts with longitudinal and circumferential cracks is investigated. The longitudinal cracked section of the shaft section is modeled as a shaft with reduced torsional rigidity.  The torsional rigidity is obtained as a function of the crack depth.  It was found for various shaft diameters, torsional rigidity could be represented as a function of crack depth/ shaft radius only. The circumferential cracked section is modeled as a torsional spring. The torsional spring constant has been obtained using fracture mechanics. It was found the resonance frequency of the shaft may be little affected by the presence of longitudinal crack.  The resonance frequencies of the shaft with the circumferential crack depend on the crack length and location.

Representative samples were collected with a newly developed source dilution sampling system after an aging process designed to simulate atmospheric dilution and cooling conditions. Samples were analyzed with established procedures and compared between the measurements taken from a baseline heavy-duty diesel engine and also from the same engine equipped with the exhaust aftertreatment system. The results have shown significant reductions for nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, total hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and organic carbon emissions. Additionally, less significant yet notable reductions were observed for particulate matter mass and metals emissions. Although two ionic compounds, sulfate and nitrate, displayed increased emission levels, the production of new species was not observed with the addition of the zeolite urea-selective catalytic reduction system joined with a downstream oxidation catalyst.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a825eeeab88da001112b545/,353,https://engrxiv.org/a3vyh/,10.31224/osf.io/a3vyh,10.3155/1047-3289.58.10.1258,2018-02-13T03:46:29.936478,2018-07-02T11:39:06.921852
8hznu,"Comparative analysis on the effects of diesel particulate filter and selective catalytic reduction systems on a wide spectrum of chemical species emissions","Two methods, diesel particulate filter (DPF) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems, for controlling diesel emissions have become widely used, either independently or together, for meeting increasingly stringent emissions regulations world-wide. Each of these systems is designed for the reduction of primary pollutant emissions including particulate matter (PM) for the DPF and nitrogen oxides (NOx) for the SCR. However, there have been growing concerns regarding the secondary reactions that these aftertreatment systems may promote involving unregulated species emissions. This study was performed to gain an understanding of the effects that these aftertreatment systems may have on the emission levels of a wide spectrum of chemical species found in diesel engine exhaust. Samples were extracted using a source dilution sampling system designed to collect exhaust samples representative of real-world emissions. Testing was conducted on a heavy-duty diesel engine with no aftertreatment devices to establish a baseline measurement and also on the same engine equipped first with a DPF system and then a SCR system. Each of the samples was analyzed for a wide variety of chemical species, including elemental and organic carbon, metals, ions, n-alkanes, aldehydes, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, in addition to the primary pollutants, due to the potential risks they pose to the environment and public health. The results show that the DPF and SCR systems were capable of substantially reducing PM and NOx emissions, respectively. Further, each of the systems significantly reduced the emission levels of the unregulated chemical species, while the notable formation of new chemical species was not observed. It is expected that a combination of the two systems in some future engine applications would reduce both primary and secondary emissions significantly.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a825d4ebab7f5000d443251/,317,https://engrxiv.org/8hznu/,10.31224/osf.io/8hznu,10.1021/es8004046,2018-02-13T03:41:27.455580,2018-07-02T11:39:06.887389
8p4zj,"Comparative Study on Various Methods for Measuring Engine Particulate Matter Emissions","Studies have shown that there are a significant number of chemical species present in engine exhaust particulate matter emissions. Additionally, the majority of current world-wide regulatory methods for measuring engine particulate emissions are gravimetrically based. As modern engines produce increasingly lower particulate mass emissions, these methods become less and less stable and have high levels of measurement uncertainty.  
In this study, a characterization of mass emissions from engines with a range of particulate emission levels was made in order to gain a better understanding of the variability and uncertainty associated with common mass measurement methods, as well as how well these methods compare with each other. Two gravimetric mass measurement methods and a reconstructed mass method were analyzed as part of the present study. The results have shown that each of the mass measurement methods analyzed compare well at higher emission levels, but show significant disparity at the ultra-low emission levels commonly seen from modern diesel engines. Additionally, at ultra-low emission the uncertainty in the measurement becomes large, thus reducing confidence in the accuracy of the measurement. Based upon these findings, it would be difficult to justify a comparison between any two gravimetric measurement methods and it may be more appropriate to perform a reconstruction of the particulate mass due to a lower susceptibility to measurement error.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a825b37bab7f5001044201c/,297,https://engrxiv.org/8p4zj/,10.31224/osf.io/8p4zj,10.4271/2008-01-1748,2018-02-13T03:30:57.489396,2018-07-02T11:39:06.851120

However, questions remain regarding the truly realized outcomes for students, as well as the unintended consequences that may be experienced by the partnering communities. This paper describes early results results from a four-year, mixed-method study which collected data through a combination of interviews and focus groups with members of the Engineers Without Borders USA organization, analysis and coding of completed project documentation, and observations and notes collected during a field visit to a project site. We conclude from our early data that students who are able (given sufficient resources) to fully participate in these type of projects do see positive benefits. However, barriers may prevent all students from having this opportunity. Further, the nature of student service learning projects inherently creates challenges for the communities that partner on these projects.

This paper presents a cognitive study that was conducted to explore the manner in which design teams respond to such situations. In the study, teams of undergraduate engineering students sought to solve a design task that was subject to two large, unexpected changes in problem formulation that were introduced during solving.

Statistical methods are often used to understand the driving parameters of energy consumption but rarely used to evaluate future urban renovation scenarios. Simulating whole cities using energy demand softwares can be very extensive in terms of computer resources and data collection. A new methodology, using city archetypes is proposed, here, to simulate the energy consumption of urban areas including urban energy planning scenarios. The objective of this paper is to present an innovative solution for the computation and visualization of energy saving at the city scale.
The energy demand of cities, as well as the micro-climatic conditions, are calculated by using a simplified 3D model designed as function of the city urban geometrical and physical characteristics. Data are extracted from a GIS database that was used in a previous study. In this paper, we showed how the number of buildings to be simulated can be drastically reduced without affecting the accuracy of the results. This model is then used to evaluate the influence of two set of renovation solutions. The energy consumption are then integrated back in the GIS to identify the areas in the city where refurbishment works are needed more rapidly.

rsxad,"Enhancement of Shear Transfer in Composite Deck with Mechanical Fasteners","Reinforced concrete construction and steel construction are two of the most common contemporary construction methods. Both methods make use of composite decks as floor systems and diaphragms. During the design of composite decks, the interaction between the steel deck and concrete slab is typically disregarded when calculating the strength of the composite di- aphragm due to lack of complete shear transfer, as existing practices such as stamping are not effective to provide substantial composite action. This conservative assumption essentially results in non-efficient use of material. This paper presents a method for ensuring shear transfer through the use of conventional sheet metal screws, driven through the corrugated steel deck and embedded in the fresh concrete. This method is proposed for use in the field between formed steel beams. Both experimental and analytical stud- ies support an increase in strength with the addition of embedded fasteners. Further, experimental results indicate an additional increase in strength with the addition of synthetic reinforcing fibers. The increase in strength with the addition of the fasteners is on the order of 100%. When fasteners are already in use, the addition of synthetic reinforcing fibers can increase strength on the order of 10%. The ultimate deflection of enhanced deck is comparable to deck tested without fasteners, but the initial stiffness of enhanced deck is much higher.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a7626b09f6c6e001095f394/,376,https://engrxiv.org/rsxad/,10.31224/osf.io/rsxad,10.1016/j.engstruct.2015.01.046,2018-02-03T21:18:53.600454,2018-07-02T11:38:24.490016
jbw3z,"Combining Multi-body Dynamics and Potential Flow Simulation Methods to Model a Wave Energy Converter","Numerical simulations that predict the dynamics and performance of wave energy converters (WECs) require the simulation of complex fluid-structure interactions between a WEC device and the wave environment. Navier- Stokes computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and fully time-domain boundary integral equation methods (BIEMs) can be coupled with multi-body dynamics solvers to simulate these problems. However, the computational resources that are required to perform these types of high-fidelity simulations are significant, precluding the use of CFD and time-domain BIEM for design optimization. One method for reducing the numerical complexity of WEC simulations is to model the hydrodynamics using frequency- domain simulations, while model the dynamic motion of the WEC device in the time-domain using multi-body dynamics methods.
The primary objective of the work presented herein is to develop such a numerical tool using the multi-body solver SimMechanics and the frequency-domain hydrodynamics code WAMIT. The numerical tool was developed so that WEC devices comprised of arbitrarily connected bodies, power-take-off (PTO) systems, and mooring systems can be simulated in operational sea states, where the wave environment can be modeled under linear assumptions.

Human-powered water pumps have been used with great success in this rapidly developing market. KickStart's MoneyMaker Hip Pump is a human-powered water pump with additional design features that make it lightweight and portable for use in remote fields in several countries throughout Africa. This work first applied numerical optimization techniques to the design of the MoneyMaker Hip Pump and offers further improvements to its design. Deterministic multi-objective optimization methods were employed to maximize the flow rate of the pump, maximize the pumping height of water, and minimize cost. Following optimization, the robustness of the optimized pump design was analyzed under several modified scenarios, including fouling of the hoses and a decrease in operator power due to fatigue or aging. The set of cost-optimized pump designs was then compared to a second set of optimal designs that was found using material volume as a simplified proxy for the cost objective function. Findings indicate that several technical improvements can be made to the current MoneyMaker Hip Pump design to reduce cost by up to 37% without affecting water flow rate, or increase water flow rate by up to 88% without increasing cost.

Most of them have been limited to commercial applications such as vehicular tracking (e.g tracking of a train etc). However, not much work has been done towards design of a personal tracking system. Our Research work is an attempt to design such personal tracking system. In this paper, we have shared glimpses of
our research work.
The objective of our research project is to design &amp; develop a system which is capable of tracking and monitoring a person, object or any other asset of importance (called as target). The system uses GPS to determine the exact position of the target. The target is aided with a compact handheld device which consists of a GPS receiver and GSM modem. GPS receiver obtains location coordinates (viz. Latitude &amp; Longitude) from GPS satellites. The location information in NMEA format is decoded, formatted and sent to control station, through a GSM modem. Due to use of Open CPU development platform, no external Microcontroller is required, with additional advantage of compact size product, reduced design &amp; development time and reduced cost.

vn72w,"Numerical  investigation  of  the  mechanical properties  of  the  additive  manufactured  bone scaffolds  fabricated  by  FDM:  the  effect  of  layer penetration and post-heating","In recent years, thanks to additive manufacturing technology, researchers have gone towards the optimization of bone scaffolds for the bone reconstruction. Bone scaffolds should have appropriate biological as well as mechanical properties in order to play a decisive role in bone healing. Since the fabrication of scaffolds is time consuming and expensive, numerical methods are often utilized to simulate their mechanical properties in order to find a nearly optimum one. Finite element analysis is one of the most common numerical methods that is used in this regard. In this paper, a parametric finite element model is developed to assess the effects of layers penetration׳s effect on inter-layer adhesion, which is reflected on the mechanical properties of bone scaffolds. To be able to validate this model, some compression test specimens as well as bone scaffolds are fabricated with biocompatible and biodegradable poly lactic acid using fused deposition modeling. All these specimens are tested in compression and their elastic modulus is obtained. Using the material parameters of the compression test specimens, the finite element analysis of the bone scaffold is performed. The obtained elastic modulus is compared with experiment indicating a good agreement. Accordingly, the proposed finite element model is able to predict the mechanical behavior of fabricated bone scaffolds accurately. In addition, the effect of post-heating of bone scaffolds on their elastic modulus is investigated. The results demonstrate that the numerically predicted elastic modulus of scaffold is closer to experimental outcomes in comparison with as-built samples.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a46fd58b794960010b0da4f/,1265,https://engrxiv.org/vn72w/,10.31224/osf.io/vn72w,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2016.01.031,2017-12-30T02:53:25.841293,2018-07-02T11:33:26.480151
y4pfe,"Ultimate behaviour of cladding assemblages in industrial buildings","Profiled steel sheeting is widely used as cladding systems in industrial buildings. These systems are normally composed of thin-walled cold-formed steel profiles attached to steel purlins, or side-rails, which are connected to the column elements by means of simple fastener arrangements. Extensive research has been carried out on the response of cold-formed cladding systems under out of plane loading and codified recommendations are available to estimate their resistance under serviceability and ultimate limit states for the purpose of conventional design verifications. Attention has also been placed recently on quantifying the degree of rotational flexibility offered by purlin-sheeting systems. Nevertheless, the ultimate response of such configurations involves complex interactions within the cladding-purlin-connection assemblage that need to be carefully examined in order to assess and quantify the large deformation response.
The study reported in this paper focuses on the inelastic response of industrial cladding systems which are designed and detailed according to conventional European practice. Selected results from a series of quasi-static tests performed within a wider collaborative project aimed at assessing the local and global static and dynamic behaviour of industrial building systems are presented. Due to the comparatively more robust response of typical industrial frame elements, the tests focus on the performance of cladding-purlin-column assemblages. The test layout and boundary conditions are described and the discussion is centred on key structural response parameters, namely stiffness, strength and failure conditions. Preliminary numerical assessments carried out with a view to providing further analytical and design studies are also outlined.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a4557bf67d19e000e6a9bfb/,630,https://engrxiv.org/y4pfe/,10.31224/osf.io/y4pfe,,2017-12-28T20:52:15.636920,2018-07-02T11:31:08.623584

Briefly, geometrically various groups of pure PLA scaffolds (interconnected pores of 230 to 390 μm) were fabricated using FDM technique. After mechanical evaluation, ES technique was utilized to develop gelatin-forsterite nanofibrous layer. To study these scaffolds, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and uniaxial compression tests were performed. Furthermore, bioactivity of the scaffolds was evaluated by immersing in the simulated body fluid and apatite formation on the surface of the scaffolds was investigated. Results depicted that elastic modulus of PLA/gelatin-forsterite scaffolds, fabricated by a combinational approach, was significantly higher than that of pure one (about 52%). SEM images showed the formation of calcium phosphate-like precipitates on the surface of these scaffolds, confirming the effects of nanocomposite fibrous layer on the improved bioactivity of the scaffolds. Regarding the obtained biological as well as mechanical properties, the developed bio-composite scaffolds can be used as a biocompatible candidate for bone tissue regeneration.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a415a41b794960013ae416f/,270,https://engrxiv.org/yt6w7/,10.31224/osf.io/yt6w7,10.1016/j.matdes.2017.07.051,2017-12-25T20:16:44.211540,2018-07-02T11:31:06.273454

Two case studies were used: the first was a detailed analysis of increasing levels of SE in the development of a 3D-printer for fabricating superconducting nano-circuitry. Applying SE techniques improved record keeping, reduced the risk of failure modes and took better account of future development through which scientific discovery may be exploited in practical devices. The second case study focused on a group of 30 quantum physics PhD students undertaking a short-course in basic SE, and used their opinions to check and add confidence to the findings of the first case study.

7wmha,"Application of a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) Based Artificial Neural Network to Cetane Number Predictions","Due to the high cost and time required to synthesize alternative fuel candidates for comprehensive testing, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) can be used to predict fuel properties, allowing researchers to preemptively screen desirable fuel candidates. However, the accuracy of an ANN is limited by its error, measured by the root mean square error (RMSE), standard deviation, and r-squared values derived from a given input database. The present work improves upon an existing model for predicting the Cetane Number (CN) by changing the neuron activation function of the ANN from sigmoid to rectified linear unit (ReLU). This change to the ANN’s architecture provides an increase in accuracy by reducing the RMSE by 21.4% (1.35 CN units), the average standard deviation across models by 28%, and increasing the r-squared value by 0.0492 across a wide range of molecular structures. Additionally, by using the ReLU activation function, input data is not required to be normalized, which reduces the likelihood of an inaccurate prediction on future fuel candidates which may have input parameters outside the range of normalization. Increasing the accuracy of the predictive ANN in this way will allow researchers to obtain more accurate fuel property predictions for promising fuel candidates.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a26d0b386b219000e8aec93/,670,https://engrxiv.org/7wmha/,10.31224/osf.io/7wmha,10.1115/ICEF2017-3614,2017-12-05T17:04:00.792571,2018-07-02T11:27:27.623613

Notably, recent advances in biomaterials and three-dimensional (3D) printing have enabled the manipulation of two or more biomaterials of distinct, yet complementary, mechanical and/or biological properties to form so-called hybrid scaffolds mimicking native tissues. Among various biomaterials, hydrogels synthesized to incorporate living cells and/or biological molecules have dominated due to their hydrated tissue-like environment. Moreover, dispensing-based bioprinting has evolved to the point that it can now be used to create hybrid scaffolds with complex structures. However, the complexities associated with multi-material bioprinting and synthesis of hydrogels used for hybrid scaffolds pose many challenges for their fabrication. This paper presents a brief review of dispensing-based bioprinting of hybrid scaffolds for TE applications. The focus is on the design and fabrication of hybrid scaffolds, including imaging techniques, potential biomaterials, physical architecture, mechanical properties, cell viability, and the importance of vessel-like channels. The key issues and challenges for dispensing-based bioprinting of hybrid scaffolds are also identified and discussed along with recommendations for future research directions. Addressing these issues will significantly enhance the design and fabrication of hybrid scaffolds to and pave the way for translating them into clinical applications.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a1ef05c9ad5a102722a2264/,919,https://engrxiv.org/zuav2/,10.31224/osf.io/zuav2,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2017.11.037,2017-11-29T23:24:37.685079,2018-07-02T11:25:51.134418

a6zmp,"A novel contact interaction formulation for voxel-based micro-finite-element models of bone","Voxel-based micro-finite-element (μFE) models are used extensively in bone mechanics research. A major disadvantage of voxel-based μFE models is that voxel surface jaggedness causes distortion of contact-induced stresses. Past efforts in resolving this problem have only been partially successful; i.e., mesh smoothing failed to preserve uniformity of the stiffness matrix, resulting in (excessively) larger solution times, whereas reducing contact to a bonded interface introduced spurious tensile stresses at the contact surface. This paper introduces a novel ‘smooth’ contact formulation that defines gap distances based on an artificial smooth surface representation while using the conventional penalty contact framework. Detailed analyses of a sphere under compression demonstrated that the smooth formulation predicts contact-induced stresses more accurately than the bonded contact formulation. When applied to a realistic bone contact problem, errors in the smooth contact result were under 2%, whereas errors in the bonded contact result were up to 42.2%. We conclude that the novel smooth contact formulation presents a memory-efficient method for contact problems in voxel-based μFE models. It presents the first method that allows modeling finite slip in large-scale voxel meshes common to high-resolution image-based models of bone while keeping the benefits of a fast and efficient voxel-based solution scheme.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59ff5e9f594d900265659b9a/,600,https://engrxiv.org/a6zmp/,10.31224/osf.io/a6zmp,10.1002/nme.5810,2017-11-05T19:16:07.627813,2020-08-04T12:57:34.255585

qywzp,"Predicting Liquefaction in Near-Real-Time (NRT): An Assessment of Geospatial vs. Geotechnical Models During the Canterbury Earthquakes","Semi-empirical models based on in-situ geotechnical tests have become the standard
of practice for predicting soil liquefaction. Since the inception of the “simplified”
cyclic-stress model in 1971, variants based on various in-situ tests have been
developed, including the Cone Penetration Test (CPT). More recently, prediction
models based soley on remotely-sensed data were developed. Similar to systems
that provide automated content on earthquake impacts, these “geospatial” models
aim to predict liquefaction for rapid response and loss estimation using readilyavailable
data. This data includes (i) common ground-motion intensity measures
(e.g., PGA), which can either be provided in near-real-time following an earthquake,
or predicted for a future event; and (ii) geospatial parameters derived from digital
elevation models, which are used to infer characteristics of the subsurface relevent
to liquefaction. However, the predictive capabilities of geospatial and geotechnical
models have not been directly compared, which could elucidate techniques for
improving the geospatial models, and which would provide a baseline for measuring
improvements. Accordingly, this study assesses the realtive efficacy of liquefaction
models based on geospatial vs. CPT data using 9,908 case-studies from the 2010-
2016 Canterbury earthquakes. While the top-performing models are CPT-based, the
geospatial models perform relatively well given their simplicity and low cost.
Although further research is needed (e.g., to improve upon the performance of
current models), the findings of this study suggest that geospatial models have the
potential to provide valuable first-order predictions of liquefaction occurence and
consequence. Towards this end, performance assessments of geospatial vs.
geotechnical models are ongoing for more than 20 additional global earthquakes",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59f56e1a594d90026bd6c7b6/,682,https://engrxiv.org/qywzp/,10.31224/osf.io/qywzp,,2017-10-29T06:01:38.129297,2018-07-02T11:19:43.795274

Towards  this  end,  the recent  Canterbury,  New  Zealand, earthquakes,  in  conjunction  with  others,  have resulted  in liquefaction case-history data of unprecedented quantity and quality, presenting a unique opportunity to rigorously develop fragility-functions for liquefaction-induced ground failure. Accordingly, this study analyzes nearly 10,000 liquefaction case studies from 23 global earthquakes to develop fragility functions for use in performance-based frameworks. The proposed functions express the probability of exceeding specific severities of liquefaction surface manifestation as a function of three different liquefaction damage measures (LDMs), wherein four alternative liquefaction-triggering models are used. These functions have the same functional form, such that end-users can easily select the model coefficients for the particular damage state, triggering model, and LDM of their choosing.It should be noted that these functions are not to be used to predict  lateral  spreading,  which  requires LDMs other  than  those  assessed  herein.

Towards this end, the study presented herein develops and analyzes a database of 10,000 high-quality liquefaction case histories resulting from the CES. The objectives of these analyses are varied, but underlying each is the desire to more accurately assess liquefaction hazard for civil infrastructure (i.e., to predict both the occurrence and damage-potential of soil liquefaction). Major contributions from this work include, but are not limited to: (1) the Liquefaction Potential Index (LPI), the state-of-practice framework for assessing liquefaction hazard, is shown to produce erroneous predictions for a significant percentage of the assessed case histories; (2) the cause of poor predictions is rigorously investigated and specific shortcomings of the LPI framework are identified; (3) based on the limitations identified, and using insights from historical data, a revised liquefaction hazard framework is developed; and (4) the revised framework is shown to assess liquefaction hazard more efficiently relative to both LPI and a competing alternative framework newly proposed in the literature. Ultimately, significant room for improvement remains with respect to accurate assessment of liquefaction hazard.

The framework is illustrated through an application to depth-duration-frequency curves, which are commonly used in stormwater design. A change factor method is used to update the curves in a case study of Pittsburgh, PA. Extreme precipitation depth is expected to increase in the future for Pittsburgh for all return periods and durations examined, requiring revised standards and designs.

m9rnz,"Vector Quantization using the Improved Differential Evolution Algorithm for Image Compression","Vector Quantization (VQ) is a popular image compression technique with a simple decoding architecture and high compression ratio. Codebook designing is the most essential part in Vector Quantization. Linde–Buzo–Gray (LBG) is a traditional method of generation of VQ Codebook which results in lower PSNR value. A Codebook affects the quality of image compression, so the choice of an appropriate codebook is a must. Several optimization techniques have been proposed for global codebook generation to enhance the quality of image compression. In this paper, a novel algorithm called IDE-LBG is proposed which uses Improved Differential Evolution Algorithm coupled with LBG for generating optimum VQ Codebooks. The proposed IDE works better than the traditional DE with modifications in the scaling factor and the boundary control mechanism.  The IDE generates better solutions by efficient exploration and exploitation of the search space. Then the best optimal solution obtained by the IDE is provided as the initial Codebook for the LBG. This approach produces an efficient Codebook with less computational time and the consequences include excellent PSNR values and superior quality reconstructed images. It is observed that the proposed IDE-LBG find better VQ Codebooks as compared to IPSO-LBG, BA-LBG and FA-LBG.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59e332069ad5a102b3884df9/,606,https://engrxiv.org/m9rnz/,10.31224/osf.io/m9rnz,,2017-10-15T10:08:43.944514,2018-07-02T11:15:52.841816

9wqfn,"Measuring and Predicting Sooting Tendencies of Oxygenates, Alkanes, Alkenes, Cycloalkanes, and Aromatics on a Unified Scale","Soot from internal combustion engines negatively affects health and climate. Soot emissions might be reduced through the expanded usage of appropriate biomass-derived fuels. Databases of sooting indices, based on measuring some aspect of sooting behavior in a standardized combustion environment, are useful in providing information on the comparative sooting tendencies of different fuels or pure compounds. However, newer biofuels have varied chemical structures including both aromatic and oxygenated functional groups, making an accurate measurement or prediction of their sooting tendency difficult. In this work, we propose a unified sooting tendency database for pure compounds, including both regular and oxygenated hydrocarbons, which is based on combining two disparate databases of yield-based sooting tendency measurements in the literature. Unification of the different databases was made possible by leveraging the greater dynamic range of the color ratio pyrometry soot diagnostic. This unified database contains a substantial number of pure compounds (≥ 400 total) from multiple categories of hydrocarbons important in modern fuels and establishes the sooting tendencies of aromatic and oxygenated hydrocarbons on the same numeric scale for the first time. Using this unified sooting tendency database, we have developed a predictive model for sooting behavior applicable to a broad range of hydrocarbons and oxygenated hydrocarbons. The model decomposes each compound into single-carbon fragments and assigns a sooting tendency contribution to each fragment based on regression against the unified database. The model’s predictive accuracy (as demonstrated by leave-one-out cross-validation) is comparable to a previously developed, more detailed predictive model. The fitted model provides insight into the effects of chemical structure on soot formation, and cases where its predictions fail reveal the presence of more complicated kinetic sooting mechanisms. This work will therefore enable the rational design of low-sooting fuel blends from a wide range of feedstocks and chemical functionalities.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59bac74f594d9002514e31a4/,1250,https://engrxiv.org/9wqfn/,10.31224/osf.io/9wqfn,10.1016/j.combustflame.2017.12.005,2017-09-14T18:23:26.438347,2019-03-04T20:27:19.773207

Transferring the application of this technology to a field environment still has some uncertainties due to scale-up challenges. In order to identify the scale-up factor, a 80 kg soil reactor system was developed, consisting of a custom made reactor, climate chamber, low flow venting system and an off gas capture device. Sandy and clayey soils were tested with known concentrations of spiked synthetic gasoline. Various environmental conditions were monitored which included: moisture levels, pH, microbial levels, nutrient and oxygen levels. Results show a second stage degradation rate similar to the degradation rate obtained from research conducted with a 4 kg reactor, giving an average scale-up factor of 2.3±0.4.

The field of assistive technology, which provides a means of achieving greater independence and standard of living through the integration of technology with the tasks of everyday life and work, served as a suitable application for the student's natural inclinations towards helping others. Supporting evidence was also found in the literature where it is argued that assistive technology is a field that provides a rich opportunity for students to engage with their peers, their community, and the world at large in a meaningful way. Further, the use of project-based design experiences has been shown to improve student engagement, use of divergent thinking, and teamwork skills.

Accordingly, this study analyzes nearly 10,000 liquefaction case studies from 23 earthquakes to develop functions that express the probability of exceeding specific severities of liquefaction surface-manifestation as a function of five different liquefaction damage measures (LDMs), of which three are based on geotechnical data and two are based on freely available geospatial data. The proposed functions have the same functional form, such that end-users can easily select the model coefficients for the particular damage state and LDM of their choosing.

The use of hydraulics for surgical robotics opens new possibilities for miniaturization and robustness. However, to enable this, there exists a need for hydraulic components which bridge the size gap between traditional fluidics and microfluidics. This paper provides motivation for the development of a miniature hydraulic valve designed specifically to enable a serpentine style hydraulic surgical manipulator. Included are a description of the various considerations relevant to the valve and its specific application, such as the method of manipulation for the valve, as well as a theoretical valve design and a mathematical description of the operating principles. Two possible methods of valve activation, piezoelectric and electromagnetic, are discussed along with two physical realizations of the valve design are presented which demonstrate the theoretical design. Finally, the results of experimental testing performed on valve prototypes is described to evaluate the design options and help inform the selection of the final configuration.

The present study proposes a new method for analyzing the local CW kinematics from OEP measurements based on the kinematics of triangular Cosserat point elements (TCPEs). 52 reflective markers were placed on the anterior CW to create a mesh of 78 triangles according to an anatomical model. Each triangle was characterized by a TCPE and its kinematics was described using four time-variant scalar TCPE parameters. The total CW volume ( VTCW) and the contributions of its six compartments were also estimated, using the same markers. The method was evaluated using measurements of ten healthy subjects, nine patients with Pompe disease, and ten patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), during spontaneous breathing (SB) and vital capacity maneuvers (VC) in the supine position. TCPE parameters and compartmental volumes were compared with  VTCW by computing the phase angles θ (for SB) and the correlation r (for VC) between them. Analysis of θ and r of the outward translation parameter PT of each TCPE revealed that for healthy subjects it provided similar results to those obtained by compartmental volumes, whereas for the neuromuscular patients the TCPE method was capable of detecting local asynchronous and paradoxical movements also in cases where they were undistinguished by volumes.

Moreover, TCPE pose estimations were compared with the estimations of two least squares minimization methods applied to the cluster of all markers, using rigid body (RBLS) and homogeneous deformation (HDLS) assumptions. Analysis was performed on previously collected in-vivo treadmill gait data composed of simultaneous measurements of the gold-standard bone pose by bi-plane fluoroscopy tracking the subjects' knee prosthesis and a stereophotogrammetric system tracking skin-markers affected by soft tissue artifact. Femur orientation and position errors estimated from skin-marker clusters were computed for 18 subjects using clusters of up to 35 markers. Results based on gold-standard data revealed that instantaneous subsets of TCPEs exist which estimate the femur pose with reasonable accuracy (median root mean square error during stance/swing: 1.4/2.8 deg for orientation, 1.5/4.2 mm for position). A non-invasive and instantaneous criteria to select accurate TCPEs for pose estimation (4.8/7.3 deg, 5.8/12.3 mm), was compared with RBLS (4.3/6.6 deg, 6.9/16.6 mm) and HDLS (4.6/7.6 deg, 6.7/12.5 mm). Accounting for homogeneous deformation, using HDLS or selected TCPEs, yielded more accurate position estimations than RBLS method, which, conversely, yielded more accurate orientation estimations.

This work presents a method, based on continuum mechanics, to describe the kinematics of a cluster affected by STA. The cluster is characterized by Triangular Cosserat Point Elements (TCPEs) defined by all combinations of three markers. The effects of the STA on the TCPEs are quantified using three parameters describing the strain in each TCPE and the relative rotation and translation between TCPEs. The method was evaluated using previously collected ex-vivo kinematic data. Femur pose was estimated from 12 skin markers on the thigh, while its reference pose was measured using bone pins. Analysis revealed that instantaneous subsets of TCPEs exist which estimate bone position and orientation more accurately than the Procrustes Superimposition applied to the cluster of all markers. It has been shown that some of these parameters correlate well with femur pose errors, which suggests that they can be used to select, at each instant, subsets of TCPEs leading an improved estimation of the underlying bone pose.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59724dc3594d90022880d2ed/,741,https://engrxiv.org/b3az4/,10.31224/osf.io/b3az4,10.1007/s10439-015-1384-6,2017-07-21T18:58:57.529110,2018-07-02T11:03:33.183848
spge4,"Soft Tissue Artifact Compensation Using Triangular Cosserat Point Elements (TCPEs)","Existing methods which compensate for the Soft Tissue Artifact (STA) in optoelectronic motion measurements estimate the rigid motion of a nearly rigid underlying body segment based on analysis of the motion of all fiducial markers. The objective of the proposed Triangular Cosserat Point Elements (TCPE) method is to estimate the motion of the underlying body segment even when the STA in the entire cluster of markers can be large. This is accomplished by characterizing the cluster of markers with TCPEs defined by triangles based on all combinations of three markers. Then, scalar deformation measures characterizing the magnitudes of strain and relative rotation of pairs of TCPEs are defined for each TCPE. These deformation measures are used to define a filtered group of TCPEs which best represents the motion of the underlying body segment. The method was tested using an experimental setup that consists of a rigid pendulum with a deformable 300ml silicone breast implant attached to it as a simulation of the soft tissue around a bony segment. The rotation angles extracted from markers on the deformable implant were compared with simultaneous measurements of the rigid pendulum using an optoelectronic system. Analysis of the experimental data shows that this filtering process substantially reduces the error due to the STA even though the data set includes large deformations. In particular, the analysis shows that the error reduction using the TCPE approach is larger than the reductions obtained using standard least-squares minimization methods.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59724bba594d90022880d214/,773,https://engrxiv.org/spge4/,10.31224/osf.io/spge4,10.1016/j.ijengsci.2014.07.001,2017-07-21T18:50:24.561189,2018-07-02T11:03:33.135747
ufjkr,"A Sustainable Design Repository for Influencing the Eco-Design of New Consumer Products","Engineering designers are constantly seeking ways to be more innovative, decisive, and informed of emerging technologies in the design of consumer products. Design tools, such as functional decomposition, morphology, and Pugh charts help stimulate the design process. However, many early-design-phase design tools require designers to have experiential or empirical design knowledge; many of these approaches are intractable for use by novice designers or designers with little experience designing for certain new objectives. In contrast to these current tools, using repositories to store product design information can provide additional and extensive design knowledge to the global design community. Using repository data—and resultant data-driven design approaches—in the design of new products can be especially impactful for DfX design objectives such as product sustainability, about which many engineering designers have limited knowledge. In this paper, we discuss the creation of a sustainable design repository – a collection of product data that includes environmental impact information. Through the initialization of a 47-product repository case study, we seek to create data-driven design processes that can influence designers to consider environmental sustainability. We found, for example, that in the first year of a product’s life, 29-64% of the environmental impact occurs during the product’s use phase, and that uncertainty in input data (such as component manufacturing location and disposal method) can significantly contribute to environmental impact variation. The creation of this sustainable design repository highlights the need for the consideration of input uncertainties when conducting environmental impact analysis. Additionally, the repository has also been used in tandem with machine learning to understand design decisions that lead to more sustainable products. This sustainable design repository enables subsequent data-driven design research in that it provides a large dataset on which machine learning approaches can operate.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/596fcd7ab83f69022b103d3e/,891,https://engrxiv.org/ufjkr/,10.31224/osf.io/ufjkr,,2017-07-19T21:28:05.687921,2018-07-02T11:03:31.826979

jzac9,"The Holos Reactor: A Distributable Power Generator with Transportable Subcritical Power Modules","Holos is a distributable modular nuclear power generator with enhanced safety features. Holos design objectives include production of affordable pollutant-free electricity and process heat with the safest melt-tolerant and proliferation resistant fuels. The design leverages commercial tech- nologies utilized for the conversion of thermal energy into conditioned electricity. Holos can op- erate as a stand-alone electric island at sites with no power grid infrastructure and can be scaled- up or clustered to meet local electric demands. Specialized configurations of Holos generators can be airlifted and timely deployed to supply emergency electricity and process heat to disaster areas and to inaccessible remote locations. The proposed distributable electric generator is com- prised within dimensions and weight requirements compatible with International Standard Or- ganization (ISO) transport containers, and is formed by subcritical power modules protected from shock stressors during transport. Holos coupled core becomes critical and enables power generation only when multiple subcritical power modules are positioned near one another. Cool- ing of Holos fuel relies only on environmental air during operations with passive decay-heat re- moval. Depending on configurations, Holos fuel cycle is 12-20 years, with 8%-15% enriched nuclear fuel sealed at all times and contained within replaceable fuel cartridges. At the end of the fuel cycle, the fuel cartridges fit within licensed transport and storage canisters for long term storage with low decommissioning cost. Holos power conversion components can be recondi- tioned when the fuel cartridges are replaced at the end of their fuel cycles and the generator can be re-licensed to resume operation for a total generator life-span of 60 years. In this design, the thermodynamic cycle utilized to convert the core thermal energy into electricity is based on the Brayton power cycle. In some configurations, the design integrates and couples a bottoming Rankine power cycle operating with organic fluids to enhance efficiency, convert decay thermal energy into electricity and support process heat applications. Holos waste heat recovery and con- version feature also relaxes thermal loading requirements at underground spent fuel repositories. The power conversion components utilized in this design are off-the-shelf, with power ratings comparable to those forming aviation jet engines and gas turbines commercially available worldwide. This approach simplifies the design and enables factory certification following the regulatory and quality assurance programs applied by the aviation industry. Holos innovative architecture provides the means to support a distributable power source satisfying various appli- cations’ requirements with enhanced safety and substantial cost reductions, thus making Holos generators competitive, and synergetic with technology sourced on renewable energy.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/594fa682594d9002288af1c3/,2737,https://engrxiv.org/jzac9/,10.31224/osf.io/jzac9,,2017-06-25T12:50:30.275408,2018-07-02T11:01:26.397511

5v7r9,"Predicting the Cetane Number of Furanic Biofuel Candidates Using an Improved Artificial Neural Network Based on Molecular Structure","The next generation of alternative fuels is being investigated through advanced chemical and biological production techniques for the purpose of finding suitable replacements to diesel and gasoline while lowering production costs and increasing process yields. Chemical conversion of biomass to fuels provides a plethora of pathways with a variety of fuel molecules, both novel and traditional, which may be targeted. In the search for new fuels, an initial, intuition-driven evaluation of fuel compounds with desired properties is required. Due to the high cost and significant production time needed to synthesize these materials at a scale sufficient for exhaustive testing, a predictive model would allow chemists to preemptively screen fuel properties of potentially desirable fuel candidates. Recent work has shown that predictive models, in this case artificial neural networks (ANN’s) analyzing quantitative structure property relationships (QSPR’s), can predict the cetane number (CN) of a proposed fuel molecule with relatively small error. A fuel’s CN is a measure of its ignition quality, typically defined using prescribed ASTM standards and a cetane testing engine. Alternatively, the analogous derived cetane number (DCN), obtained using an Ignition Quality Tester (IQT), is a direct measurement alternative to the CN that uses an empirical inverse relationship to the ignition delay found in the constant volume combustion chamber apparatus.  DCN data points acquired using an IQT were utilized for model validation and expansion of the experimental database used in this study. The present work improves on an existing model by optimizing the model architecture along with the key learning variables of the ANN and by making the model more generalizable to a wider variety of fuel candidate types, specifically the class of furans and furan derivatives, by including specific molecules for the model to incorporate. The new molecules considered include tetrahydrofuran, 2-methylfuran, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, 5,5'-(furan-2-ylmethylene)bis(2-methylfuran), 5,5'-((tetrahydrofuran-2-yl)methylene)bis(2-methyltetrahydrofuran), tris(5-methylfuran-2-yl)methane, and tris(5-methyltetrahydrofuran-2-yl)methane. Model architecture adjustments improved the overall root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of the base database predictions by 5.54%. Additionally, through the targeted database expansion, it is shown that the predicted cetane number of the furan-based molecules improves on average by 49.21% (3.74 CN units) and significantly for a few of the individual molecules. This indicates that a selected subset of representative molecules can be used to extend the model’s predictive accuracy to new molecular classes.

94s8d,"The Effect of Heavy Working Fluids on Hydrogen Combustion","The thermodynamic efficiency of internal combustion engines is dependent on the compression ratio and specific heat ratio of the working fluid. Using a mixture of oxygen and noble gases instead of air can increase the thermal efficiency due to their higher specific heat ratio. It also has advantage of eliminating NOx caused by lack of nitrogen. In this study, the three dimensional turbulent injection of hydrogen into a constant volume combustion chamber has been modeled and compared to mixtures of oxygen with nitrogen, argon and  xenon. All conditions including the mass flow rate of the injected fuel, injection velocity, and initial temperature and pressure of the chamber were kept constant. The results indicate that the hydrogen jet has more penetration length in nitrogen compared to argon and xenon. However, the smaller penetration lengths lead to more complex jet shapes and larger cone angles. In combination with the higher specific heat ratio, combustion in a noble gas environment results in higher temperatures and OH radical concentrations. Furthermore, mixedness is investigated using mean spatial variation and mean scalar dissipation.

The use of weather databases is of major importance to choose the best location to build microalgae production facilities and to optimize influent geometrical and operating parameters, which can play wanted or unwanted roles depending on the meteorological conditions of the site.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/591ad953b83f69024e1b9caa/,677,https://engrxiv.org/753nx/,10.31224/osf.io/753nx,,2017-05-16T11:20:24.618879,2018-07-02T10:58:08.289158

Currently only about 11% of rural Malawi have electrical power access according to the world bank, sustainable energy for all database.  The rugged terrain makes it ideal for hydro power. Near Hastings Mkandawire village is a small river which is diverted through plastic pipes. These pipes are plumbed downhill, this allows Hastings to increase the pressure of the water. At the bottom of the hill the water is directed at a water wheel on a shaft hooked up to a small generator. Hastings Mkandawire is the man who started the company Magnetic Power Company who is responsible for building these small generators. Hastings started by converting motor casings and other scrap materials into Nano-hydro-generators. What Hastings would like to have in his future design is sand casted key parts so generators can be mass produced. Hastings and his business want to spread access of electricity in his community and other small towns.

Today, RFID technology is being applied in a wide array of disciplines in science research and industrial projects. The significant impact of RFID is clearly visible by the rate of academic publications in the last few years. This article surveys the literature to evaluate the trend of RFID technology development based on academic publications from 2001 to 2014. Both bibliometric and content analyses are applied to examine this topic in SCI-Index and SSCI-Index documents. Based on the bibliometric technique, all 5159 existing RFID documents are investigated and several important factors are reviewed, including contributions by country, organizations, funding agencies, journal title, authors, research area and Web of Science category. Moreover, content analysis is applied to the top 100 most cited documents and based on their contents, these top 100 documents are classified into four different categories with each category divided in several sub-categories. This research aims to identify the best source of the most cited RFID papers and to provide a comprehensive road map for the future research and development in the field of RFID technology in both academic and industrial settings. Six key findings from this review are (1) the experimental method is the most popular research methodology, (2) RFID research has been a hot area of investigation but will branch out into related subset areas, (3) South East Asia is positioned to dominate this research space, (4) the focus of research up to now has been on technical issues rather than business and management issues, (5) research on RFID application domains will spread beyond supply chain and health care to a number of different areas, and (6) more research will be related to policy issues such as security and privacy.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/590a7728594d900253541262/,810,https://engrxiv.org/53rke/,10.31224/osf.io/53rke,10.1007/s11192-016-2095-y,2017-05-04T00:37:51.104480,2018-07-02T10:56:47.027259

k736s,"On the mechanism of protein-templated gold nanoparticle synthesis: Protein organization, controlled gold sequestration, and unexpected reaction products.","Emerging applications that exploit the properties of nanoparticles for biotechnology require that the nanoparticles be biocompatible or support biological recognition. These types of particles can be produced through syntheses that involve biologically relevant molecules (proteins or natural extracts, for example). Many of the protocols that rely on these molecules are performed without a clear understanding of the mechanism by which the materials are produced. We describe a single-pot reaction in which protein-templated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are produced as either solution-suspended colloids or as colloids formed within a solid, fibrous protein structure. We have investigated the mechanism for this process by detailing the reaction kinetics and outcomes through the use of 7 different proteins over a range of concentrations and temperatures. The key factor that controls the synthetic outcome (colloid or fiber) is the concentration of the protein relative to the gold concentration. We find that the observed fibrous structures are more likely to form at low protein concentrations and when hydrophilic proteins are used. An analysis of the reaction kinetics shows that AuNP formation occurs faster at lower protein (fiber-forming) concentrations than at higher protein (colloid-forming) concentrations. These results contradict expectations for reaction kinetics and protein-fiber formation, highlighting the need for a better understanding of the mechanism by which biomolecules can facilitate nanoparticle synthesis. As the protein properties that influence this mechanism are better recognized, researchers will be able to better utilize proteins to generate geometry-controlled AuNPs.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5900ef04b83f6902514841fc/,881,https://engrxiv.org/k736s/,10.31224/osf.io/k736s,,2017-04-26T19:15:33.550287,2018-07-02T10:55:53.674033

4utb2,"Toward 3D printed hydrogen storage materials made with ABS-MOF composites","The push to advance efficient, renewable, and clean energy sources has brought with it an effort to generate materials that are capable of storing hydrogen. Metal-organic framework materials (MOFs) have been the focus of many such studies as they are categorized for their large internal surface areas. We have addressed one of the major shortcomings of MOFs (their processibility) by creating and 3D printing a composite of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and MOF-5, a prototypical MOF, which is often used to benchmark H2 uptake capacity of other MOFs. The ABS-MOF-5 composites can be printed at MOF-5 compositions of 10% and below. Other physical and mechanical properties of the polymer (glass transition temperature, stress and strain at the breaking point, and Young’s modulus) either remain unchanged or show some degree of hardening due to the interaction between the polymer and the MOF. We do observe some MOF-5 degradation through the blending process, likely due to the ambient humidity through the purification and solvent casting steps. Even with this degradation, the MOF still retains some of its ability to uptake H2, seen in the ability of the composite to uptake more H2 than the pure polymer. The experiments and results described here represent a significant first step toward 3D printing MOF-5-based materials for H2 storage.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58e79c25b83f69024f4ff9de/,1509,https://engrxiv.org/4utb2/,10.31224/osf.io/4utb2,,2017-04-07T14:15:56.250645,2018-07-02T10:55:47.557171

The X-57 is an experimental aircraft designed to demonstrate radically improved aircraft efficiency with a 3.5 times aero-propulsive efficiency gain at a “high‑speed cruise” flight condition for comparable general aviation aircraft. These gains are enabled by integrating the design of a new, optimized wing and a new electric propulsion system. As a result, the X‑57 vehicle takes advantage of the new capabilities afforded by electric motors as primary propulsors. Integrating new technologies into critical systems in experimental aircraft poses unique challenges that require careful design considerations across the entire vehicle system, such as qualification of new propulsors (motors, in the case of the X-57 aircraft), compatibility of existing systems with a new electric power distribution bus, and instrumentation and monitoring of newly qualified propulsion system devices.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58e68c116c613b024ffed274/,2063,https://engrxiv.org/wepn7/,10.31224/osf.io/wepn7,,2017-04-06T19:29:56.949048,2018-07-02T10:55:10.071326
958tq,"Fundamentals of Low-Pressure Nanofiltration: Membrane Characterization, Modeling, and Understanding the Multi-Ionic Interactions in Water Softening","Recently, a novel class of low-pressure nanofiltration (NF) hollow fiber membranes, particularly suited for
water softening and desalination pretreatment have been fabricated in-house using layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition
with chemical crosslinking. These membranes can operate at exceedingly low pressures (2 bar),
while maintaining relatively high rejections of multivalent ions. In spite of their great potential, our understanding
as to what makes them superior has been limited, demanding further investigation before any
large-scale implementation can be realized. In this study, the Donnan-Steric Pore Model with dielectric
exclusion (DSPM-DE) is applied for the first time to these membranes to describe the membrane separation
performance, and to explain the observed rejection trends, including negative rejection, and their underlying
multi-ionic interactions. Experiments were conducted on a spectrum of feed chemistries, ranging from
uncharged solutes to single salts, salt mixtures, and artificial seawater to characterize the membrane and
accurately predict its performance. Modeling results were validated with experiments, and then used to
elucidate the working principles that underlie the low-pressure softening process. An approach based on
sensitivity analysis shows that the membrane pore dielectric constant, followed by the pore size, are primarily
responsible for the selectively high rejections of the NF membranes to multivalent ions. Surprisingly,
the softening process is found to be less sensitive to changes in membrane charge density. Our findings

h5dru,"Effects of oil and water contamination on natural gas engine combustion processes","Abundant availability and potential for lower emissions are drivers for increased utilization of natural gas in automotive engines for transportation applications. A novel bimodal engine has been developed that allows on-board refueling of natural gas by utilizing the engine as a compressor. Engine compression however, results in altering the initial state of the natural gas. Increase in temperature and addition of oil are two key effects attributed to the onboard refueling process. A secondary effect is the presence of water in the natural gas supply line. This study investigates the effect of upstream conditions of natural gas on three parameters: autoignition temperature, ignition delay, and laminar flame speed. These parameters play key roles in the engine combustion process. Parametric studies are conducted by varying the initial mixture temperature, water, and oil content in the fuel. The studies utilize numerical simulations conducted with detailed chemistry for natural gas with n-heptane used as a surrogate for oil. Water addition to natural gas at 1–5% by volume did not result in any major changes in the combustion processes, other than a slight reduction in laminar flame speeds. Oil addition of 1–5% by volume reduced autoignition temperature by 5–10% and ignition delay by 27–95% depending on the initial temperature. Sensitivity analysis showed that this was likely due to decrease in the sensitivity of two recombination reactions with oil addition. Evolution profiles of key radical species also showed increasing mole fraction of the hydroperoxy radical at lower temperature that likely aids in reducing the ignition delay. Oil addition resulted in a relatively small increase in the laminar flame speed of 1.7% along with an increase in the adiabatic flame temperature. These results help inform the combustion process and performance to be expected from the bimodal engine.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58b59bd16c613b01f2fd3df1/,1301,https://engrxiv.org/h5dru/,10.31224/osf.io/h5dru,10.1016/j.jngse.2017.02.038,2017-02-28T15:53:27.533000,2018-07-02T10:49:13.148976

The Mandela Washington Fellowship for Young African Leaders brings African entrepreneurs to United States campuses for six weeks every summer, providing an excellent opportunity to identify potential clients for global engineering class projects. Many of the fellows could benefit from having access to engineering skills to grow their businesses. The university’s engineering faculty partnered with fellows on projects in freshman Impacts of Engineering, junior Lean Manufacturing, and senior Capstone Design classes. Projects have included conceptual product design, detailed product design, process selection, manufacturing equipment design, and facilities design. Several engineering and technology majors have participated in the projects. The highlight is a micro-hydroelectric generator design project spanning several classes and semesters.

The projects are similar to traditional class projects and cover all existing course objectives. Students are also required to research and apply international standards, including product, safety and facility standards. Students also must consider the appropriate level of technology, humanitarian engineering aspects, and societal impact of the design. Assessment of the international component of one project allows programs to evaluate performance indicators on the global and societal impact of designs as part of ABET Outcome H assessment. The projects are also part of a larger humanitarian engineering initiative at the institution, and are assessed through surveys for that initiative.

spread of portable devices for electronic books. However, in a number of
invented book-scanning devices, pages are turned manually by users, or
pricey three-dimensional cameras are needed for image correction. Our
automatic page-turning mechanism employs near-field electroadhesive force
to turn a single page. As the near-field electroadhesive force on the
closest sheet of paper is far stronger than that on the second, only a
single sheet of paper can be lifted. Using Fourier series expansion, we
prove that regardless of the geometrical configuration of electrodes, the
force ratio on the closest to the second is dominantly controlled by the
period of the configuration. Based on this, a novel electrode configuration
is designed aiming to give higher force ratio than the conventional
interdigital patterns. The advantage of our mechanism in image processing
is that perspective correction is compatible with our mechanism, hence not
requiring devices for acquiring 3-D information to reconstruct images. Our
automatic page-turning mechanism with a fair success rate and the reduced
number of components shows that it is a promising method for automatic
low-cost book-scanning devices.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5844e1e2b83f69004182407f/,1711,https://engrxiv.org/gq8ta/,10.31224/osf.io/gq8ta,,2016-12-05T03:41:17.271000,2018-07-02T10:49:11.892915

from a flexed biological limb, using portable, inexpensive, and
easily-available resources. *Methods:* We apply and evaluate this approach
on a person with bi-lateral transtibial amputations, imaging left and right
residual limbs in extended and flexed knee postures. We map 3D deformations
to a flexed biological limb using freeware and a simple point-and-shoot
camera. Mean principal strain, maximum shear strain, as well as lines of
maximum, minimum, and non-extension are computed from 3D digital models to
inform directional mappings of the strain field for an unloaded residual
limb.

*Results:* Peak tensile strains are ~ 0.3 on the anterior surface of the
knee in the proximal region of the patella, whereas peak compressive
strains are ~ -0.5 on the posterior surface of the knee. Peak maximum shear
strains are ~ 0.3 on the posterior surface of the knee. The accuracy and
precision of this methodology are assessed for a ground truth model. The
mean point location distance is found to be 0.08 cm, and the overall
standard deviation for point location difference vectors is 0.05 cm.

*Conclusion:* This low-cost and mobile methodology may prove critical for
applications such as the prosthetic socket interface where whole-limb skin
strain data are required from patients in the field outside of traditional,
large-scale clinical centers.

Traditional load forecasting is implemented at substation levels to predict the upcoming active power and optimal system settings. In more advanced smart grid applications, e.g. the Volt-VAR Control, small-scale load forecasting opens up new opportunities in coordinating distributed resources such as distributed generation (DG) with utilities' efficiency missions. This paper proposes a STLF approach for small residential blocks with 10-12 households. The Nonlinear Autoregressive Neural Network (NAR-NN) is employed to predict hour-ahead active (P) and reactive (Q) powers with a moving window of training data. The regressor shrinkage technique, LASSO, is used to improve the selection of the regressors in the NAR-NN model by removing insignificant input features. The results show the forecasting performance could be enhanced by ~20% comparing to feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).

The assumption of a weak energy source necessitates also minimizing parasitic energy draws.  We present results for a power compressor composed of a boost converter (variable voltage upconversion), a harvest regulator (matching impedances on the fly), and a bank of low-leakage capacitors (high current draw for short times).  The power compressor was not externally powered.  Performance was evaluated while connected to two direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs) in series, for periods of 3 and 10 days.  The DEFCs' design was not optimized for power.  They were non-flowing, room-temperature, air-cathode, PtRu/Pt units, which simulated the output of small BHFCs.  The power compressor automatically kept the DEFCs close to the voltage yielding maximum power output, which was 400 mV for two DEFCs in series.  The output voltage of the capacitor bank was repeatedly raised to 10.25 V and then discharged to 5 V through a resistor.

In the current study, this LTC fuel performance index was calculated computationally and analyzed for a number of fuel blends comprised of n-heptane, isooctane, toluene, and ethanol in various combinations and ratios corresponding to octane numbers from 0 to 100. In order to calculate the LTC index for each fuel, computational driving cycle simulations were first performed using a typical light-duty passenger vehicle, providing pairs of engine speed and load points. Separately, for each fuel blend considered, single-zone naturally aspirated HCCI engine simulations with a compression ratio of 9.5 were performed in order to determine the operating envelopes. These results were combined to determine the varying improvement in fuel economy offered by fuels, forming the basis for the LTC fuel index. The resulting fuel performance indices ranged from 36.4 for neat n-heptane (PRF0) to 9.20 for a three-component blend of n-heptane, isooctane, and ethanol (ERF1). For the chosen engine and chosen conditions, in general lower-octane fuels performed better, resulting in higher LTC fuel index values; however, the fuel performance index correlated poorly with octane rating for less-reactive, higher-octane fuels.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57c3c4b39ad5a101e8145ad1/,1036,https://engrxiv.org/f9tm8/,10.31224/osf.io/f9tm8,,2016-08-29T05:14:22.249000,2018-07-02T10:49:06.677971

However, engines can only successfully operate in HCCI mode for limited operating ranges that vary depending on the fuel composition. Unfortunately, traditional ratings such as octane number (ON) poorly predict the auto-ignition behavior of fuels in such engine modes, and metrics recently proposed for HCCI engines have areas of improvement when wide ranges of fuels are considered.

Mobile applications such as automotive vehicles are one such area. This work presents the design, modeling, simulation and testing of a two-region micro-channel heat exchanger, employing both engine coolant and R134a, for use in an engine that compresses natural gas for on-board refueling at pressures up to 250 bar. The novel design of the micro-channel heat exchanger is presented. Numerical simulations were performed using ANSYS Fluent utilizing extrapolation techniques to estimate the pressure drop as a function of flow rate and symmetry methods to investigate heat transfer. Pressure drop was determined experimentally, and heat transfer was investigated through system tests employing the novel engine. Experimental results showed good comparison with corresponding numerical simulations which demonstrated the validity of the applied extrapolation and symmetry methods, enabling considerable reduction in computational cost. The pressure drop, flow distribution, and heat transfer characteristics of the heat exchanger are discussed.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57c281b4b83f6901fdc4a7d1/,2383,https://engrxiv.org/jw8n9/,10.31224/osf.io/jw8n9,,2016-08-28T06:16:17.985000,2018-07-02T10:51:07.033335

g8h9n,"Automated and Data-driven Computational Design of Patient-Specific Biomechanical Interfaces","Biomechanical interfaces are mechanical structures that form the connection between a device and a tissue region, and, through appropriate load transfer, aim to minimize tissue discomfort and injury. A patient-specific and data-driven computational framework for the automated design of biomechanical interfaces is presented here. Optimization of the design of biomechanical interfaces is complex since it is affected by the interplay of the geometry and mechanical properties of both the tissue and the interface. The proposed framework is presented for the application of transtibial amputee prostheses where the interface is formed by a prosthetic liner and socket. Conventional socket design and manufacturing is largely artisan, non-standard, and insufficiently data-driven, leading to discrepancies between the quality of sockets produced by different prosthetists. Furthermore, current prosthetic liners are often not patient-specific. The proposed framework involves: A) non-invasive imaging to record patient geometry, B) indentation to assess tissue mechanical properties, C) data-driven and automated creation of patient-specific designs, D) patient-specific finite element analysis (FEA) and design evaluation, and finally E) computer aided manufacturing. Uniquely, the FEA procedure controls both the design and mechanical properties of the devices, and simulates, not only the loading during use, but also the pre-load induced by the donning of both the liner and the socket independently. Through FEA evaluation, detailed information on internal and external tissue loading, which are directly responsible for discomfort and injury, are available. Further, these provide quantitative evidence on the implications of design choices, e.g. : 1) alterations in the design can be used to locally enhance or reduce tissue loading, 2) compliant features can aid in relieving local surface pressure. The proposed methods form a patient-specific, data-driven and repeatable design framework for biomechanical interfaces, and by enabling FEA-based optimization reduces the requirement for repeated patient involvement in the currently manual and iterative design process.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57b1e509594d9001ff540628/,1439,https://engrxiv.org/g8h9n/,10.31224/osf.io/g8h9n,,2016-08-15T15:53:44.247000,2019-12-16T16:34:19.055004

Currently, there are no proposed solutions to aid those with hand tremors insert a catheter comfortably. The shaking motion of a tremor can make catheter insertion painful because the patient will have difficulty inserting the catheter into the small opening of the urethra. If the shaking motion of the tremor was reduced or suppressed, the catheter would enter the body more smoothly and in turn make the cathing process easier and more comfortable. In addition, an automated device would help the patient insert the catheter more steadily into the body. This paper discusses a preliminary idea for an assistive robotic device that would aid with catheter insertion for hand tremor patients.

j7nrf,"Breast ultrasound tomography versus magnetic resonance imaging for clinical display of anatomy and tumor rendering: Preliminary results","*Abstract*

*Objective: *To determine the clinical display thresholds of an ultrasound
tomography (UST) prototype relative to magnetic resonance (MR) for
comparable visualization of breast anatomy and tumor rendering.

*Materials and Methods: *The study was compliant with HIPAA, approved by
the IRB, and performed after obtaining informed consent. Thirty-six women
were imaged with MR and our UST prototype. The UST scan generated
reflection, sound speed and attenuation images. The reflection images were
fused with the components of sound speed and attenuation images that
achieved thresholds to represent parenchyma and/or solid masses using an
image arithmetic process. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons of MR
and UST clinical images were used to identify anatomical similarities, and
optimized thresholds for tumor shapes and volumes.

*Results: *Thresholding techniques generated UST images comparable to MR
for visualizing fibrous stroma, parenchyma, fatty tissues, and tumors, of
which 25 were cancer and 11 benign.  Optimized sound speed thresholds of
1.46±0.1 km/s and 1.52±0.03 km/s were identified to best represent the
extent of fibroglandular tissue and solid masses, respectively. An
arithmetic combination of attenuation images using the threshold of
0.16±0.04 dB/cm further characterized benign from malignant masses.  No
significant difference in tumor volume was noted between benign or
malignant masses by UST or MR (p>0.1) using these universal thresholds.

*Conclusion: *UST demonstrated the ability to image and render breast
tissues in a manner comparable to MR. Universal UST threshold values appear
feasible for rendering of the size and distribution of benign and malignant
tissues without intravenous contrast.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57a0ab1d6c613b01efbf92f0/,973,https://engrxiv.org/j7nrf/,10.31224/osf.io/j7nrf,,2016-08-02T14:15:56.274000,2018-07-02T10:51:04.444052
wca5h,"Analysis of an approach for detecting arc positions during vacuum arc remelting based on magnetic flux density measurements","Vacuum arc remelting (VAR) is a melting process for the production of homogeneous ingots, achieved by applying a direct current to create electrical arcs between the input electrode and the resultant ingot. Arc behavior drives quality of the end product, but no methodology is currently used in VAR furnaces at large scale to track arcs in real time. An arc position sensing (APS) technology was recently developed as a methodology to predict arc locations using magnetic field values measured by sensors. This system couples finite element analysis of VAR furnace magnetostatics with direct magnetic field measurements to predict arc locations. However, the published APS approach did not consider the effect of various practical issues that could affect the magnetic field distribution and thus arc location predictions. In this paper, we studied how altering assumptions made in the finite element model affect arc location predictions. These include the vertical position of the sensor relative to the electrode-ingot gap, a varying electrode-ingot gap size, ingot shrinkage, and the use of multiple sensors rather than a single sensor. Among the parameters studied, only vertical distance between arc and sensor locations causes large sources of error, and should be considered further when applying an APS system. However, averaging the predicted locations from four evenly spaced sensors helps reduce this error to no more than 16 % for a sensor position varying from 0.508 m below and above the electrode-ingot gap height.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/579db02b594d9001fd2fce87/,1328,https://engrxiv.org/wca5h/,10.31224/osf.io/wca5h,,2016-07-31T08:00:42.364000,2018-07-02T10:53:47.753447

yvz57,"Uniaxial and Biaxial Mechanical Properties of Porcine Linea Alba","Trocar site hernia (or incisional hernia) is a severe complication post
laparoscopic surgery that is commonly associated with the linea alba.
However, the few studies on the mechanical properties of the linea alba in
the literature appear contradictory, possible due to challenges with the
physical dimensions of samples and variations in protocol. This study
focuses on the tensile mechanical characterisation of the porcine linea
alba, as determined by uniaxial and equi-load biaxial testing using
image-based strain measurement methods. Results show that the linea alba
demonstrated a non-linear elastic, anisotropic behaviour which is often
observed in biological soft tissues. The transverse direction (parallel to
fibres) was found to be approximately 8 times stiffer than the longitudinal
(cross-fibre) direction under both uniaxial and equi-load biaxial loading.
The equi-load biaxial tensile tests revealed that contraction could occur
in the transverse direction despite increasing load, probably due to the
anisotropy of the tissue. Optical surface marker tracking and digital image
correlation methods were found to greatly improve the accuracy of stretch
measurement, resulting in a 75% change in the apparent stiffness compared
to using strain derived from machine cross-head displacement. Additionally,
a finite element model of the experiments using a combination of an Ogden
and fibre exponential power law model for the linea alba was implemented to
quantify the effect of clamping and tissue dimensions (which are suboptimal
for tensile testing) on the results. The preliminary model results were
used to apply a correction factor to the uniaxial experimental data prior
to inverse optimisation to derive best fit material parameters for the
fibre reinforced Ogden model. Application of the model to the equi-load
biaxial case showed some differences compared to the experimental data,
suggesting a more complex anisotropic model may be necessary to capture
biaxial behaviour. These results provide an improved assessment of the
mechanical properties of the porcine linea alba for wound closure and other
studies.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/579bad33594d9001fa2fcd2d/,2216,https://engrxiv.org/yvz57/,10.31224/osf.io/yvz57,,2016-07-29T19:23:29.631000,2018-07-02T10:55:04.768246

esjbz,"On Advantages of the Kelvin Mapping in Finite Element Implementations of Deformation Processes","Classical continuum mechanical theories operate on three-dimensional
Euclidian space using scalar, vector, and tensor-valued quantities usually
up to the order of four. For their numerical treatment, it is common
practice to transform the relations into a matrix-vector format. This
transformation is usually performed using the so-called Voigt mapping. This
mapping does not preserve tensor character leaving significant room for
error as stress and strain quantities follow from different mappings and
thus have to be treated differently in certain mathematical operations.
Despite its conceptual and notational difficulties having been pointed out,
the Voigt mapping remains the foundation of most current finite element
programmes. An alternative is the so-called Kelvin mapping which has
recently gained recognition in studies of theoretical mechanics. This
article is concerned with benefits of the Kelvin mapping in numerical
modelling tools such as finite element software. The decisive difference to
the Voigt mapping is that Kelvin’s method preserves tensor character, and
thus the numerical matrix notation directly corresponds to the original
tensor notation. Further benefits in numerical implementations are that
tensor norms are calculated identically without distinguishing stress or
strain-type quantities and tensor equations can be directly transformed
into matrix equations without additional considerations. The only
implementational changes are related to a scalar factor in certain finite
element matrices and hence, harvesting the mentioned benefits comes at very
little cost.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/579b9fc16c613b01fed26566/,1202,https://engrxiv.org/esjbz/,10.31224/osf.io/esjbz,10.1007/s12665-016-5429-4,2016-07-29T18:26:08.186000,2019-02-04T11:33:27.823835

Although rupture occurs in a only small number of aneurysms, the mortality rate associated with this event is significant. Thus due to the high risk associated with rupture and the risks of rupture repair surgery it is desirable to be able to predict whether a specific aneurysm is likely to rupture or will instead stabilize. Research into aneurysm development has shown that the response cannot be quantified with simple mechanical models alone. It is also necessary to consider growth and remodeling of the tissue constituents and complex geometric stress concentrators as well. Through the production of complete aneurysm development models, it may be possible to enable accurate prediction of aneurysm rupture based on clinically observable measures such as aneurysm geometry and growth rates.

k2fhj,"Design of a Hydraulic Dexterous Manipulator for Minimally Invasive Surgery","The research described here identifies the limitations of existing robotic surgical platforms, which include the balance between the scale of the robot and its manipulability in terms of range of motion, load capacity, and tool capability, then develops a means of overcoming them by taking advantage of fluid power as an enabling technology with its inherent power density and controllability. The approach described here differs significantly from conventional surgical robots in that the robot is embedded within the surgical device itself, whereas in the conventional system, a general-purpose robot is used to manipulate various surgical tools. This is done in order to demonstrate that fluid power can be used advantageously for the design of embedded surgical robotic systems for minimally invasive surgery.

To enable the design of a fluid powered surgical robot, it was first necessary to identify the design requirements for a robot of this nature as well as the considerations unique to this approach. To this end, a quantification of the necessary load capacity for natural orifice robots was conducted. Further, through a review of the literature in the fields of surgery and robotics, considerations of necessary workspace and limitations for the prevention of tissue damage were explored. The results of these analyses are presented.

The technologies that comprise this novel surgical robotic system include a hydraulic control valve, actuation units, and an enabling structure. The intended application of these technologies introduced numerous limitations and challenges to the design process. The most stringent of these limitations was that of overall size, due to the realities of patient anatomy, which prevented the use of commercially available hydraulic components. An assemblage of components to achieve the aforementioned design requirements is described including the design of a novel hydraulic control valve to enable manipulation of three actuators using a single valve sized to fit within the working channel of a surgical endoscope.

The advantage of the described approach is that the device enables greater miniaturization, improves cost effectiveness, and has better ease of mobility. The mobility and the relaxed requirements for operating room cleanliness can be potentially useful for mobile clinics, out-patient clinical settings, and on the battlefield. Being more cost effective and having a small overall size, the robotic assisted surgical devices can be widely deployed, even in rural or other less technology intensive environments. Through careful review of the literature and analytical evaluation of the various proposed concepts, it was possible to arrive at a design that meets the needs of modern surgical interventions while addressing the perceived limitations of existing surgical robotics.

Through the efforts described in this dissertation, much new information was produced and developments resulted. The considerations of hydraulic power for surgical robots were evaluated and are applicable to other surgical tasks where hydraulic power may be used advantageously. A quantification of the load requirements for surgical robots performing abdominal procedures was produced which will provide a guide for other researchers developing surgical robots. These values are difficult to find in the literature and are a valuable resource for the field. An alternative, simplified model for predicting the behavior of continuum beams under load was developed to provide an inverse formulation for computing beam shape and end loads. This is useful as continuum beams are widely used for minimally invasive surgical manipulators as well as in a wide variety of other applications. Finally, a novel valve concept and two possible designs realizing this concept were developed. These valve designs facilitate control over the three actuators in an antagonistic arrangement. Further, the valve designs enable proportional control of the three actuators at a size scale not commercially available. In summary, the design of a novel hydraulic surgical manipulator as a summation of its parts has been performed. This design demonstrates the feasibility of the fluid power approach to embedded minimally invasive surgical robotics. The pursuit of this research has provided many unique challenges and the work presented here has addressed many of them, as well as laid the foundation for future developments in the application of hydraulic power to the growing field of surgical robotics for minimally invasive surgery.",1,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57990e496c613b01f9ecf49d/,1100,https://engrxiv.org/k2fhj/,10.31224/osf.io/k2fhj,,2016-07-27T19:40:53.720000,2018-07-02T10:51:07.262765

Through these educational activities, service learning seeks to engage students in critical thinking processes while simultaneously achieving a greater sense of civic and social responsibility through targeted participation in meaningful community service activities. However, in practice, service learning can take a variety of forms predicated on technical, cultural, societal, and political constraints. Thus, while some work shows positive effects on students' attitudes, social behaviour, and academic performance, less research has demonstrated long-term community impact. Nor has much research shown that participation in service learning has a long-term impact on students' ethical perspectives and frameworks, and whether those ethical frames carry on to their professional careers. Moreover, as institutions partner with such humanitarian service groups as Engineers Without Borders USA, we know considerably less about the institutional cultures and climates that are developed through such partnerships and how sustainable they are, given those inherent technical, political and cultural limitations.

xjpcm,"Incorporation of liberal education into the engineering curriculum at a polytechnic","Traditional engineering education often falls short when it comes to the inclusion of issues related to social justice, ethics, and globalization. While engineering programs are required to include ethics content for accreditation, most seem to rely primarily on general education electives, providing only a high-level overview and including the bare minimum in the program core. This can lead to an inconsistent student experience and minimal exposure to topics which are critically important for achieving worldwide equity and operating responsibly in the engineering workplace. Given the role that engineers play in economic development, this is unacceptable. It is therefore the responsibility of engineering educators to find a better way to shape the future of the engineering profession. This paper outlines the early efforts at integrating the topics of ethics, social justice, and social responsibility more directly into the engineering curriculum. This is approached from the perspectives of pedagogy, curriculum development, and service learning opportunities.  It is within this context that the authors hope to influence students' awareness of and connection to social and environmental issues as well as the ethical frameworks they develop and carry with them into their professional careers. This paper centers around the creation and delivery of a new introductory engineering course combining liberal education topics and introductory engineering topics.
