# engrXiv-print-count

This is a pair of documents used to calculate the statistics behind documents posted on Engineering Archive. The data is collected using the PHP script (modified from [here](https://bitbucket.org/octogroup/osf-preprint-list)). The jupyter notebook here is used on: https://blog.engrxiv.org/stats/

## Set API token

Set the API access token as `apiToken`

## The Jupyter Notebook

The Jupyter notebook is just a small bit of Python to plot the results that are stored in the CSV file generated by the PHP script. The current data file used in the notebook is hosted here: https://osf.io/ns9yr/

## Download all engrXiv files

The bash script `download_engrxiv.sh` uses the `engrxiv-papers.csv` file which is created using the PHP script, there is an occasionally updated version [available on OSF](https://osf.io/ns9yr/). The CSV file is read using `csvtool` and then the primary file for each preprint is downloaded using `wget`. Each file is saved as _GUID.pdf_.
